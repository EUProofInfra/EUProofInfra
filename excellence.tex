\section*{Readiness of the project}

To conclude this part on Excellence, let us mention that this idea of
building such a standard for proofs has already been investigated in
the past, such as in the QED manifesto \cite{Qed94}, but has produced
limited results.

Our thesis is that, since the times of QED, the situation has radically
changed. After thirty years of research, we have an empirical evidence
that most of the formal proofs developed in one of these systems can
also be developed in another. We understand the relationship between
the theories implemented in these systems much better. We have
developed several logical frameworks, extending predicate logic, in
which these theories can be expressed. And we have developed reverse
mathematics algorithms to analyze which axioms and rules are used in
each proof and algorithms, such as constructivisation algorithms, to
translate proofs from one theory to another.

So, while the QED manifesto was premature, the time is ripe to
remember the values it defended: knowledge sharing, safety, security,
privacy, open access, education, etc. A boost on formal methods in
Europe is needed, at a time where bugs have killed enough people, and
threaten the existence of enough enterprises.

We need to strengthen citizen's confidence in science and technology.

As the technology is ready, let us make it happen altogether.
