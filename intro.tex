Bugs kill and, if testing may reveal some bugs, only
formal verification can guarantee their absence.  Thus, we should
never fly in an autonomous plane fully driven by a piece of software,
that has not been formally verified.

Today, the trust in critical systems relies on formal verification, in
particular formal proofs, that guaranty the safety of the people using
transportation systems---autonomous car, subways, trains, planes,
etc.---, health systems---robotic surgery, etc.---, energy provided by
nuclear plants, financial applications, e-governance, etc. The crucial
role of formal proof is highlighted by several successes, like the
correctness proof of the automatic Paris metro line 14 \cite{metro14},
the detect-and-avoid system for unmanned aircraft system developed
by NASA \cite{Munoz16}, the proved operating system seL4 \cite{Klein09},
or the proved C compiler CompCert \cite{Leroy06}. Because formal methods are crucial in the
development of the information society, because people can die and
companies bankrupt because of a bug, it is crucial for Europe to
master this technology and its evolution.

A lot of formal proofs developed for one application could be used in
another.  Unfortunately, the development of formal methods is slowed
down by the large number of proof systems and the lack of a common
theory used by these systems.  Because each small community is
centered around one theory and one system, and each system has its own
library of proofs, interoperability, sustainability, and
crossverification are restricted, and often same work has to be done
again elsewhere.  For instance, the Paris metro line 14 has been proved
correct in {\sc Atelier B}, while the Nasa detect-and-avoid system for
unmanned aircraft system has been proved correct in {\sc PVS}. Some
projects, such as the Flyspeck project, have been started in different
systems and required some effort to be completed in just one system.

There are around twenty major proof systems in the world (Figure
\ref{systems}) and making these systems interoperable would avoid work
duplication, reduce the development time, and allow independent
verification.  After three decades dedicated to the development of
these systems, allowing such a cooperation between these systems is
the next step in the development of the formal proof technology.  A
cloud of formal proofs could bring to the applications of formal proof
technology the same boost that the cloud has brought to computing.

In January 2019, we put online a first prototype of {\sc Logipedia},
an encyclopedia of formal proofs, expressed in the language of five
different systems. At that time, this encyclopedia contained only a
few hundreds proofs. We organized a meeting to discuss the future
of this project {\tt
  http://deducteam.gforge.inria.fr/seminars/190121.html}.  This
meeting brought together 38 researchers from Austria, Czech Republic,
France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Poland. Since then, colleagues
from Belgium, Germany, Serbia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom have
manifested interest. These researchers are ready to contribute to
develop this encyclopedia aiming at having in twenty years all the
formal proofs then developed, in a single encyclopedia.
