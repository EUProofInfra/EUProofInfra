\section{Key Exploitable results}

Logipedia is a Key Exploitable Results, each domain specific library
(on real analysis, probability...) is also a Key Exploitable Result,
each specific development made available to all provers (CompCert?,
CakeML?...) is a Key Exploitable Result, as well as each proof in
Logipedia. Formalized datastructures and algorithms shared accros
provers are a Key Exploitable Result.

Indexing algorithms and seach engines are Key Exploitable Results.

User interfaces are Key Exploitable results.

API and package distribution systems are Key Exploitable Results.

Logipedia as a repository for proofs referenced in publications, 
in mathematics, in computer science and in other sciences is a
Key Exploitable Result.

- Each import feature to Logipedia and each export
feature from  Logipedia is a 
Key Exploitable Result.
