Bugs may kill. Would you fly in an autonomous plane fully driven by a
piece of software that has not been formally verified?  Or formally
verified using a technology that Europe does not master? Today, the
trust in critical systems relies on formal methods, in particular
formal proofs, that guaranty the safety of the people using
transportation systems---autonomous car, metros, trains, planes,
etc.---, health systems---robotic surgery, etc.---, energy provided by
nuclear plants, etc. The crucial role of formal proof is highlighted
by several successes, like the correctness proof of the automatic
Paris metro line 14 \cite{metro14} or the detect and avoid system for
unmanned aircraft system developed by Nasa \cite{Munoz16}.

Unfortunately, the development of formal methods is slowed down by the
multiplicity of proof systems and the lack of a common theory used by
these systems. This restricts interoperability, sustainability,
certification, etc.  each small community being centered around one
theory and one system, and often re-doing work done elsewhere.  For
instance, the metro line 14 has been proved correct in {\sc Atelier
B}, while the Nasa detect and avoid system for unmanned aircraft
system has been proved correct in {\sc PVS}.

There are around twenty major proof systems in the world
(Figure \ref{systems}) and making these systems interoperable would avoid work
duplication, reduce the development time, and allow independent
certification.  After three decades dedicated to the developement of
these systems, allowing such a cooperation between these systems is
the next step in the developement of the formal proof technology.
