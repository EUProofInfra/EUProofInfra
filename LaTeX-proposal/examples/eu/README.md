# `euproposal.cls` and `eureport.cls` Examples

This directory contains examples for EU proposals and reports marked up with the 
proposal/euproposal class. 

`strep`:        a STREP proposal
`lib`: 		 shared files (affiliation database, bibTeX, logos)

It would be great to have mock proposals for other EU proposal categories here (please
help).
