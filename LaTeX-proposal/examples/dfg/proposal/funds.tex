\section{Requested Modules/Funds}\label{sec:funds}

For each applicant, we apply for funding within the Basic Module.

\subsection{Funding for Staff}\label{sec:positions}

\subsubsection{Research Staff}\label{sec:positions:research}

We apply for the following positions. All run over the entire duration of the proposed project.

\paragraph*{Non-doctoral staff}\ednote{compute amount in elan and copy here}

One doctoral researcher for 2 years at $100 \%$ for Michael Kohlhase.

One doctoral researcher for 2 years at $100 \%$ for Florian Rabe.

%\paragraph*{Postdoctoral staff}
%\ednote{postdoctoral researcher and comparable}

\paragraph*{Other research assistants}\ednote{students with BSc.}

One student with BSc. for 2 years at $100 \%$ for Michael Kohlhase.

One student with BSc. for 2 years at $100 \%$ for Florian Rabe.

\subsubsection{Non-Academic Staff \qquad None.}

\subsubsection{Student Assistants \qquad None.}

\subsection{Funding for Direct Project Costs}\label{sec;funds:direct}

\subsubsection{Equipment up to 10,000 \texteuro, Software and Consumables}

None.  PC will cover the workspace, computing needs, and consumables for its staff as part
of the basic support.

\subsubsection{Travel Expenses}\label{sec:travel}

\begin{oldpart}{rework}
  The travel budget shall cover:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item visits to external collaborators. We expect two international visits. We estimate
    that each visit will be most effective, if the junior researchers can spend about 3
    weeks with the partners. Thus we estimate 2500 {\texteuro} per visit.
  \item visits to national conferences to disseminate the results of {\pn}. We expect
    one visit for each year for each of the three researchers. (3 x 3 x 1000 {\texteuro})
  \item visits to international conferences to disseminate the results of {\pn}. These
    are in particular the International Joint Conference on Document Engineering (DocEng)
    and the Tech User Group Meeting (TUG). We expect one visit for each proposed
    researcher and for each year. (3 x 3 x 1500 {\texteuro})
  \end{itemize}

  This sums up to a total amount of 32.500 {\texteuro} for travel expenses for the whole
  funding period of three years which is split into 16.250 {\texteuro} for each institute
  (PC and Jacobs University).
\end{oldpart}

\subsubsection{Visiting Researchers}\label{sec:funds:visiting}

Total expenses \textbf{10.200 \texteuro}
\medskip

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:travel}, we expect 5 incoming research visits.  Assuming
an average duration of 3 weeks, we estimate the cost of one visit at 600 {\texteuro} for
traveling and 70 {\texteuro} per night for accommodation, amounting to 2040 \texteuro per
visit.
