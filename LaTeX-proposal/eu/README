euproposal.cls: A class for preparing FP7 proposals for collaborative projects

The euproposal class supports many of the specific elements of a Framework 7 Proposal. It
is optimized towards collaborative projects. The package comes with extensive examples. To
start a new proposal just copy a suitable one and modify it to your needs. Note that the
structure of EU proposals changes from time to time, so that the examples may be out of
date.

The class eudelivreport.cls is experimental, it is being developed for the
