dfgproposal.cls: A class for preparing DFG proposals for collaborative projects
dfgreporting.cls: A class for reporting on DFG projects. 

The dfgproposal and dfgreporting classes supports many of the specific elements of an
Einzelantrag to the DFG and the respective reporting documents. It is optimized towards
collaborative projects. The package comes with extensive examples. To start a new proposal
or report just copy the respective directory and modify. Note that the structure of EU
proposals changes from time to time, so that the examples may be out of date.
