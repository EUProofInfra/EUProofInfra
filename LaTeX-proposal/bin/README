This directory contains the binaries for the proposal class.

We have three utilities: 
- filedate and checksum are for managing metadata in the
   DTX files of the sTeX distribution (written in perl)
-  Modparse.pm is a perl library they depend on
- generate-issues is a ruby library that generates issues
   on http://github.com for the project (experimental)
