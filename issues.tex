\chapter{Ethical Issues}\label{chap:ethical}
\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}
  Describe any ethical issues that may arise in the project. In particular, you should
  explain the benefit and burden of the experiments and the effects it may have on the
  research subject. Identify the countries where research will be undertaken and which
  ethical committees and regulatory organisations will need to be approached during the
  life of the project.

  Include the Ethical issues table below.  If you indicate YES to any issue, please
  identify the pages in the proposal where this ethical issue is described. Answering
  'YES' to some of these boxes does not automatically lead to an ethical review1.  It
  enables the independent experts to decide if an ethical review is required. If you are
  sure that none of the issues apply to your proposal, simply tick the YES box in the last
  row.
