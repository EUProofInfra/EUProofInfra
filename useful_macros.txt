In general, see the documentation of the proposal package in Latex-Proposal/base and Latex-Proposal/eu.

-------------------------------------------

For references to a
- WP:
      \WPref{WPID}
   or \WPtref{WPID} to include the title
- task in another WP:
      \taskref{WPID}{TASKID}
   or \tasktref{WPID}{TASKID} to include the title
- task in the same WP:
      \localtaskref{TASKID} 

- \derivref, \derivtref, and \localderivref work accordingly for deliverables
      
-------------------------------------------
      
Declaring a task or WP:

\begin{task}[id=ID, title=TITLE, lead=SITE1, SITE1RM=8, SITE2RM=6]

Here "RM" is fixed and "SITE1" etc. must be replaced with the respective site id.
The same syntax works on \begin{workpackage}, and we should make sure that for each site the resources per WP are indeed the sum of the resources per task.

-------------------------------------------

Declaring a deliverable:

\begin{wpdeliv}[id=ID,lead=SITE,due=MONTH,miles=MILESTONEID]{TITLE}
EXPLANATION
\end{wpdeliv}

where
- SITE is the leading site
- MONTH is the number of the month when the deliverable is due
- MILESTONEID is the id of the milestone to which the deliverable is assigned

Additionally, the keys 'dissem' and 'nature' allow fine-tuning the type of the deliverable. I'm not sure if and how we will need that.

------------------------------------------- 
      
To make notes for each other that appear in margin and footnote:
- \ednote{NOTE}
- To make it easy for everybody to find all relevant notes, use the format
  NOTE ::= FROM(@TO)*:TEXT
  FROM ::= last name of author of the note
  TO   ::= "all" | last name of a person, which should act on the note
  TEXT ::= the body of the note
 
  For example,
   \ednote{Rabe@Dowek@Blanqui: check if you like this}
   \ednote{Dowek@all: improve this text}
