We know how to express in Dedukti the theories implemented in Matita,
HOL Light, FoCaliZe, Coq, Agda, Lean, Minlog, Isabelle, HOL4,
Atelier B, and Rodin. The systems Matita, HOL Light, FoCaliZe, and
Coq, already have been instrumented to export proofs that can be
checked in Dedukti. Our first work package is to do the same thing for
Coq, Agda, Lean, Minlog, Isabelle, HOL4, Atelier B, and
Rodin. Three methods have to be used here: some of the systems
(Automath style), such as Coq, Agda, Lean, and Minlog already have
proof-terms that can be output, thus the main task is to translate
these proofs into the Dedukti format. Others (LCF style), such as
Isabelle and HOL4, have an inference kernel that can be
instrumented, and often already has, the main task here is to transform
the internal proof-object into an external proof-term. Others, such as
Atelier B and Rodin are slightly more difficult to address. For those,
we need to use the water ford method: extract an incomplete trace (a
sequence of lemmas) and fill the gap using automated theorem proving,
as experimented with Atelier B and Zenon.
