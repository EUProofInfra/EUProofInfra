[G\"oteborg]

The HOL4 proof assistant is home to a few medium to large scale
specifications and associated proof developments that have value
outside of HOL4. These specifications include the formal semantics of
the CakeML language (and its verified compiler) and an extensive
specification of the ARM instruction set architecture (ISA) as
formalised by Anthony Fox at the University of Cambridge.

HOL4 has support for exporting proofs to the OpenTheory proof exchange
format, and there has been some work on importing OpenTheory proofs
into Dedukti. However, the current state of these techniques and their
implementations does not scale to real examples such as those
mentioned above.

This part of the project will be about re-thinking and re-designing
the tools HOL4-to-OpenTheory and OpenTheory-to-Dedukti tools such that
they scale to the point where real examples of interest, such as those
mentioned above, can be exported.
