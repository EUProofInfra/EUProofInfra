\paragraph{Task 5.42: Ecumenical Dedukti}

[Grienenberger, Dowek]

We plan to define in {\sc Dedukti} both constructive and classical
connectives and quantifiers
following \cite{PrawitzPereira,DowekPereira,Pereira}, so that both
constructive and classical proofs can be expressed in {\sc Dedukti}.

We plan to develop constructivization algorithms to transform proofs
expressed in this theory, into its constructive fragment.

\paragraph{Task 5.43: A universal type theory}

[Grienenberger, Dowek]

A type theory that contains both a dependent and non dependent arrow
contains two fragments that correspond to Simple type theory and to
the Calculus of constructions. Such a theory can express proofs
developed in HOL Light, Isabelle, HOL4, Coq, Matita...

We plan to develop algorithms to transform proofs expressed in this
theory, into its Simple type theory fragment.
