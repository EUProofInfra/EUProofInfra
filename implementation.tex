\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated in the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms, and the number of person months, shown in the detailed work package descriptions.

Please provide the following:

- a table showing number of person months required (table 3.4a)

- a table showing ‘other direct costs’ (table 3.4b) for participants where those  costs exceed 15\% of the personnel costs (according to the budget  table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms) and participants providing trans-national access under this project and incurring travels and subsistence costs for supporting users' access.

Please note that the distribution of resources between access (TA/VA), JRA, and NA components must be duly justified.

\subsection{Subcontracting}\label{sec:subcontracting}

\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}
  If any part of the work is to be sub-contracted by the participant responsible for it,
  describe the work involved and explain why a sub-contract approach has been chosen for
  it.
\end{todo}

The tasks \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle},
\taskref{libraries}{afp} (both handled by \site{Tum}) and part of
task~\taskref{structuring}{strontorepml} (handled by \site{Fau}) will
be carried out by subcontracting Dr.\ M.\ Wenzel.  Each subcontract
will cover roughly the equivalent of $3$ person-months.  Concretely,
it concerns the export of proof terms and other data from the Isabelle
system.  Wenzel is the main Isabelle developer and has spent the
last $10$ years building the technological prerequisites for the
required work and is the natural person to carry it out.  However, he
has left academia and started his own enterprise that specializes on
Isabelle kernel development and routinely carries out subcontracts for
Isabelle-related research projects.  Therefore, a subcontract is the
best option as developing the necessary expertise in-house would take
an additional 6-12 person-months per task.  \site{Fau} has already worked with
Wenzel in similar subcontracts twice before (including the
OpenDreamKit EU infrastructure project), and the collaborations have
been very effective and efficient. Wenzel obtained his Ph.D. at
\site{Tum} advised by Nipkow.

The task \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle} (handled by \site{Tum})
requires special assistance by Dr.\ David Matthews (PROLINGUA LTD,
Edinburgh): As provider of the underlying Poly/ML infrastructure,
Matthews is in a unique position to provide extra scalability of ML
heap management, and thus allow Isabelle to export more library
material.

\subsection{Subcontracting costs}\label{sec:subcontracting-costs}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:subcontracting}, \site{Tum} asks for
EUR~50.000 and \site{Fau} for EUR~20.000 to subcontract Dr.\ M.\ Wenzel to
carry out (part of) the work in task
\taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}, \taskref{libraries}{afp} and
\taskref{structuring}{strontorepml}. Further EUR~15.000 are required
by \site{Tum} to subcontract Dr.\ D.\ Matthews to participate in
critical parts of task \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}.
\ednote{Rabe@Dowek: This is part
  of the WP7 budget. But it is not included in the PMs in WP7 because
  money for subcontracts must be declared in a different column in the
  official EU tables. Instead, it is listed here.}
