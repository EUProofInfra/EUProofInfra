Note that 51\% of the effort is made by French partners (accordingly,
49\% of the budget is allocated to French partners). This was difficult to
avoid because the coordinating site is French and two large formal proof
communities: the B community and the Coq community are French.
We have tried to compensate by having more geographic diversity in the
managerial structure of the projects with work package leaders from
six different countries: Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, The
Netherlands, and Serbia.

\subsection*{Subcontracting}\label{sec:subcontracting}

The tasks \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle},
\taskref{libraries}{afp} (both handled by \site{Tum}) and part of
task~\taskref{structuring}{strontorepml} (handled by \site{Fau}) will
be carried out by subcontracting Dr.\ M.\ Wenzel.  Each subcontract
will cover roughly the equivalent of $3$ person-months.  Concretely,
it concerns the export of proof terms and other data from the Isabelle
system.  Wenzel is the main Isabelle developer and has spent the
last $10$ years building the technological prerequisites for the
required work and is the natural person to carry it out.  However, he
has left academia and started his own enterprise that specializes on
Isabelle kernel development and routinely carries out subcontracts for
Isabelle-related research projects.  Therefore, a subcontract is the
best option as developing the necessary expertise in-house would take
an additional 6-12 person-months per task.  \site{Fau} has already worked with
Wenzel in similar subcontracts twice before (including the
OpenDreamKit EU infrastructure project), and the collaborations have
been very effective and efficient. Wenzel obtained his Ph.D. at
\site{Tum} advised by Nipkow.

The task \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle} (handled by \site{Tum})
requires special assistance by Dr.\ David Matthews (PROLINGUA LTD,
Edinburgh): As provider of the underlying Poly/ML infrastructure,
Matthews is in a unique position to provide extra scalability of ML
heap management, and thus allow Isabelle to export more library
material.

{\bf Cost.} \site{Tum} asks for
EUR~50.000 and \site{Fau} for EUR~20.000 to subcontract Dr.\ M.\ Wenzel to
carry out (part of) the work in task
\taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}, \taskref{libraries}{afp} and
\taskref{structuring}{strontorepml}. Further EUR~15.000 are required
by \site{Tum} to subcontract Dr.\ D.\ Matthews to participate in
critical parts of task \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}.

\subsection*{In-kind contributions on the beneficiary’s premises}

As declared in the online proposal submission form, the section 3
``budget'', the Logipedia consortium has declared a number of in-kind
contributions. That is why the requested EU Contribution (K) of our
consortium is a smaller amount than the max EU contribution (J). The
community supporting the Logipedia project is wide but each partner
has been thoroughly selected and is necessary for the success of the
project. A budget of 5 millions euros is too limited to support all
the efforts of the community. The difference between the total
eligible costs for the project and the requested will therefore be
supported by some partners as an-kind contribution.
