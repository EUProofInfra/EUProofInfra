Cost breakdown per actvity:
80\% of the budget funds the seven scientific and technological work
packages (17\%, 13\%, 8\%, 7\%, 8\%, 16\%, and 10\%), 11\% is for the
work package ``Dissemination, communication, and exploitation'', and
9\% for the work package ``Management''.

Cost breakdown of direct cost per type: 87\% of the budget is for personnel,
11\% for missions, and 1\% for subcontracting. 

Note that 48\% of the budget is allocated to French partners.  This
was difficult to avoid because the coordinating site is French and
also two large formal proof communities, the B community and the Coq
community, are French.  Nevertheless the consortium is very
international, as it counts eleven countries, and most European
centers of excellence in formal proofs are represented.

\subsection*{In-kind contributions on the beneficiary’s premises}

As declared in the online proposal submission form, the section 3
``budget'', the Logipedia consortium has declared a number of in-kind
contributions. That is why the requested EU Contribution (K) of our
consortium is a smaller amount than the max EU contribution (J). The
community supporting the Logipedia project is wide but each partner
has been thoroughly selected and is necessary for the success of the
project.
A budget of 5 millions euros is too limited to support all
the efforts of the community.
The partners are so commited to the successful implementation of the
project that they have agreed in-kind contributions.
The difference between the total
eligible costs for the project and the requested will therefore be
supported by some partners as an-kind contribution.

\subsection*{Justification for mission costs}

\site{Bir}
leads two dissemination tasks: 
\taskref{dissemination}{training} on training and 
\taskref{dissemination}{researchers-club} on academic users.
Both of these tasks will require frequent travel to meetings and workshops.
UoB furthermore participates in \taskref{theories}{hott}, which is led by Barras and a PhD student in Paris. A large portion of mission funding is for supporting disadvantaged participants at training events and workshops.

\site{Stu}
applies only for compensation for necessary travel costs. It
provides its personnel as an in-kind donation to support the
project. In particular, it will support \WPref{atpetc} (instrumenting
an ATP to provide suitable proof traces) and \WPref{dissemination} (in
particular co-supervising a PhD-candidate with ULiege). Since DHBW does
not apply for any other funds, the mission budget is 100\% of the
total budget allocated to DHBW.

\site{Lie}
is leading \WPref{dissemination}, and will centralize the budget for
organizing the yearly Logipedia conference.  Furthermore the PhD student
co-supervised with DHBW will regularly visit DHBW, for periods that will span
several weeks.

  presenting results at conferences, and inviting external (non-EU) experts
  on some specialized aspects of \WPref{atpetc}. \\

\site{Bel}
is part of \WPref{atpetc} and \WPref{alignment}. 
Five researchers from University of Belgrade will visit partner sites
and regular project meetings. Since they are going to work jointly
with researchers from University of Strasbourg, most visits will be
made to Strasbourg. The total budget for missions allocated to
University of Belgrade is aligned with other participants in the
project, but, since Serbia is low income country, researcher salaries
are lower and mission budget consumes a higher percentage of the
allocated budget.

{\color{red} TO DO by Catherine}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\site{Ias} 
is is leading the task~\taskref{theories}{matching} from the
workpackage~\WPref{theories}. 
Since \taskref{theories}{matching} depends on the 
tasks~\taskref{atpetc}{instrumenting} and \taskref{atpetc}{tracetodedukti},
a part of the budget for mission is dedicated to visit the partners leading
these tasks.  The rest of the mission budget is dedicated to
 participating Logipedia meetings/workshops 
 and for disseminating results at conferences.
