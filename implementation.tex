Cost breakdown per actvity:
80\% of the budget funds the seven scientific and technological work
packages (17\%, 13\%, 8\%, 7\%, 8\%, 16\%, and 10\%), 11\% is for the
work package ``Dissemination, communication, and exploitation'', and
9\% for the work package ``Management''.

Cost breakdown of direct cost per type: 87\% of the budget is for personnel,
11\% for missions, and 1\% for subcontracting.

Note that 48\% of the budget is allocated to French partners.  This
was difficult to avoid because the coordinating site is French and
also two large formal proof communities, the B community and the Coq
community, are French.  Nevertheless the consortium is very
international, as it counts eleven countries, and most European
centers of excellence in formal proofs are represented.

\subsection*{In-kind contributions on the beneficiary’s premises}

As declared in the online proposal submission form, the section 3
``budget'', the Logipedia consortium has declared a number of in-kind
contributions. That is why the requested EU Contribution (K) of our
consortium is a smaller amount than the max EU contribution (J). The
community supporting the Logipedia project is wide but each partner
has been thoroughly selected and is necessary for the success of the
project.
A budget of 5 millions euros is too limited to support all
the efforts of the community.
The partners are so commited to the successful implementation of the
project that they have agreed in-kind contributions.
The difference between the total
eligible costs for the project and the requested will therefore be
supported by some partners as an-kind contribution.

\site{Lie} is going to contribute 7 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by the University of Liège.

\site{Sac} is going to contribute 12 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by Université Paris-Saclay.

\site{Imt} is going to contribute 9 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by Institut Mines-Télécom.

\site{Bia} is going to contribute 22 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by the University of Bialystok.

\site{Stu} is going to contribute 2 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by the Duale Hochschule Baden-Württemberg.

\site{Inn} is going to contribute 5 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by the University of Innsbruck.

\site{Tou} is going to contribute 28 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by the INPT.

\site{Lmu} is going to contribute 6 PM in-kind for the whole duration of the project.
This contribution is already funded by the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\"at M\"unchen.

  \site{Lie} is leading \WPref{dissemination}, and will centralize the

  approximate cost of 25k€ per conference, for about 100 people attending.

  \site{Bel}
is part of \WPref{atpetc} and \WPref{alignment}.
Five researchers from University of Belgrade will visit partner sites
and regular project meetings. Since they are going to work jointly
with researchers from University of Strasbourg, most visits will be
made to Strasbourg. The total budget for missions allocated to
\site{Bel} is aligned with other participants in the
project, but, since Serbia is a low income country, researcher salaries
are lower and mission budget consumes a higher percentage of the
allocated budget.

  Burel is leading \taskref{atpetc}{tracetodedukti} on
reconstructing Dedukti proofs from proof traces. This task depends on
\taskref{atpetc}{instrumenting} on producing such traces. He will
therefore need to meet the participants of these tasks, in particular
the PhD student co-supervised by \site{Lie} and \site{Stu}.

Dubois is leading the dissemination task \taskref{dissemination}{certifiers-club} on promoting the use of Logipedia by certification authorities, in particular by European public institutions. This task will require travels to meet these institutions. Furthermore she leads and participates in \taskref{instrumentation}{atelier-b} on the translation of B models into Dedukti, with \site{Tou} team. Mission funding will help her to travel to meetings and workhops with this team.\\

\site{Bir} leads two dissemination tasks:
\taskref{dissemination}{training} on training and
\taskref{dissemination}{researchers-club} on academic users.
Both of these tasks will require frequent travel to meetings and workshops.
A large portion of mission funding is for supporting disadvantaged participants at training events and workshops.\\

  \site{Stu} applies for compensation for necessary travel costs. It
  provides most its personnel as an in-kind donation to support the
  project. In particular, it will support \WPref{atpetc}
  (instrumenting an ATP to provide suitable proof traces) and
  \WPref{dissemination} (in particular co-supervising a PhD-candidate
  with \site{Lie}). Since \site{Stu} does not apply for significant other
  funds, the mission budget is nearly all of the total budget
  allocated to it.

  Travel \& subsistence for trans-national access (if applicable) & 10,000 &

  \site{Ias} is leading the task~\taskref{theories}{matching} from the
workpackage~\WPref{theories}.
Since \taskref{theories}{matching} depends on the
tasks~\taskref{atpetc}{instrumenting} and \taskref{atpetc}{tracetodedukti},
a part of the budget for mission is dedicated to visit the partners leading
these tasks.  The rest of the mission budget is dedicated to
 participating Logipedia meetings/workshops
 and for disseminating results at conferences.
 The total budget for missions allocated to
\site{Ias} is aligned with other participants in the
project, but, since Romania is a low income country, researcher salaries
are lower and mission budget consumes a higher percentage of the
allocated budget.
