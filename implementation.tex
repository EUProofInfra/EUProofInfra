\section{Consortium as a whole}\label{sec:consortium}

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}

  The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate
  section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.

  Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives, and bring together the necessary expertise? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? 

  In what way does each of them contribute to the project? Show that each has a valid role, and adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role. 

  If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.2). 

  Other countries and international organisations: If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country or is an international organisation that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries, from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme, and, under specific conditions, from further countries identified in the work programme1,are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project .

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated in the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms, and the number of person months, shown in the detailed work package descriptions.

Please provide the following:

- a table showing number of person months required (table 3.4a)

- a table showing ‘other direct costs’ (table 3.4b) for participants where those  costs exceed 15\% of the personnel costs (according to the budget  table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms) and participants providing trans-national access under this project and incurring travels and subsistence costs for supporting users' access.

Please note that the distribution of resources between access (TA/VA), JRA, and NA components must be duly justified.

\subsection{Subcontracting costs}\label{sec:subcontracting-costs}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:subcontracting}, \site{Tum} asks for
EUR~50.000 and \site{Fau} for EUR~20.000 to subcontract Dr.\ M.\ Wenzel to
carry out (part of) the work in task
\taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}, \taskref{libraries}{afp} and
\taskref{structuring}{strontorepml}. Further EUR~15.000 are required
by \site{Tum} to subcontract Dr.\ D.\ Matthews to participate in
critical parts of task \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}.
\ednote{Rabe@Dowek: This is part
  of the WP7 budget. But it is not included in the PMs in WP7 because
  money for subcontracts must be declared in a different column in the
  official EU tables. Instead, it is listed here.}
