\section{Work plan -- Work packages, deliverables}

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
  Please provide the following:

  * brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan;
  
  * timing of the different work packages and their components (Gantt chart or similar);

  * detailed work description, i.e.:
  
        - a list of work packages (table 3.1a);

        - a description of each work package (table 3.1b);

        - a list of major deliverables (table 3.1c);

  * graphical presentation of the components showing how they inter-relate (Pert chart or similar).

  Give full details. Base your account on the logical structure of the project and the stages in which it is to be carried out. The number of work packages should be proportionate to the scale and complexity of the project.

  You should give enough detail in each work package to justify the proposed resources to be allocated and also quantified information so that progress can be monitored, including by the Commission.

  Resources assigned to work packages should be in line with their objectives and deliverables. Note that the primary deliverables of Integrating Activities are access provision, optimised use, and further improvement of the services offered by the participating research infrastructures. You are advised to include a distinct work package on ‘management’ (see section 3.2) and on innovation, to indicate in the work package title the type of activity (Networking: NA, trans-national or virtual access: TA or VA, Joint Research: JRA) for non-management work packages (see Part D of the section “Specific features for Research Infrastructures” in the 2018-2020 Research Infrastructures Work Programme), and to give due visibility in the work plan to ‘dissemination and exploitation’ and ‘communication activities’, either with distinct tasks or distinct work packages.

  You will be required to include an updated (or confirmed) ‘plan for the dissemination and exploitation of results’ in both the periodic and final reports. This should include a record of activities related to dissemination and exploitation that have been undertaken and those still planned. In the case of Integrating Activities this should moreover include dissemination of access opportunities and of the resulting use of the research infrastructure, as well as measures to assess or improve the innovation potential of the infrastructure. A report of completed and planned communication activities will also be required.

  {\bf Definitions:}

  - \underline{Work package}: means a major sub-division of the proposed project.

  - \underline{Deliverable}: means a distinct output of the project, meaningful in terms of the project's overall objectives and constituted by a report, a document, a technical diagram, a software etc.

\section{Management structure, milestones and procedures}

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
  * Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making ( including a list of milestones (table 3.2a))

  * Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project.

  * Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed in the management structure and work plan.

  Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.

  * Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project's objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b)

  * Give a summary of the trans-national and/or virtual access to be provided (table 3.2c).

  {\bf Definition:}
  
  \underline{Milestones}: means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.

\section{Consortium as a whole}\label{sec:consortium}

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
  The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.

  Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives, and bring together the necessary expertise? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? 

  In what way does each of them contribute to the project? Show that each has a valid role, and adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role. 

  If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.2). 

  Other countries and international organisations: If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country or is an international organisation that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries, from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme, and, under specific conditions, from further countries identified in the work programme1,are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project .
\end{todo}

\section{Resources to be Committed}\label{sec:resources}

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated in the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms, and the number of person months, shown in the detailed work package descriptions.

Please provide the following:

- a table showing number of person months required (table 3.4a)

- a table showing ‘other direct costs’ (table 3.4b) for participants where those  costs exceed 15\% of the personnel costs (according to the budget  table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms) and participants providing trans-national access under this project and incurring travels and subsistence costs for supporting users' access.

Please note that the distribution of resources between access (TA/VA), JRA, and NA components must be duly justified.
