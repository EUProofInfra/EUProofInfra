\section{Work plan --- Work packages, deliverables}

\subsection{Overall structure of the work plan}

Our work plan is divided into seven scientific work packages.
The first group of work packages is dedicated to the networking
activities that are needed to gather the proofs today located in
different libraries.
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.02\textwidth}|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.7\textwidth}|}
\hline
1
&
Integration
&
Instrument the systems for which we already know how to encode the
proofs in Dedukti, and make available these proofs in Logipedia.
\\
\hline
2
&
Automatic theorem proving
& 
Develop automatic theorem provers to populate,
help, and benefit from Logipedia.
\\
\hline
3
&
Large libraries
&
Export large dedicated libraries in curated form 
to Logipedia for end-user applications.
\\
\hline
\end{longtable}
The second is dedicated to making these proofs accessible, beyond
trans-national and virtual access.
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.02\textwidth}|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.7\textwidth}|}
\hline
4
&
Access
&
Define and build the Logipedia hardware and software infrastructure in
which the proofs will be integrated.
\\
\hline
5
&
Structure of the encyclopedia
&
Provide infrastructure for the structured ontological representation
of libraries and use it to enrich the information about formal
libraries in Logipedia.
\\
\hline
\end{longtable}
The third is dedicated to joint research activities that prepare
the future of Logipedia. 
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.02\textwidth}|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.7\textwidth}|}
\hline
6
&
Theories
&
Bringing proof systems implementing a theory 
that has not yet been expressed in Dedukti LIL 2 or better.
\\
\hline
7&Proof engineering &
Investigate methods for detecting concept alignments and apply
them to build a library of alignments present across the Logipedia database.
\\
\hline
\end{longtable}
Together with these seven scientific work packages, 
two more work packages are dedicated to dissemination, communication and
exploitation and to madagement.
\begin{longtable}{|p{0.02\textwidth}|p{0.2\textwidth}|p{0.7\textwidth}|}
\hline
8
&
Dissemination, communication, and exploitation
&
Expand the use of Logipedia in research, industry, education, and publishing.
\\
\hline
9
&
Management
&
Coordinate this large community, in a benevolent atmosphere, for optimal
efficiency.
\\
\hline
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Timing of the different work packages and their components}

and a column for each month.

Finishes with a miletones, deliverable and project meeting.

Put a lot of deliverables at Month 18 and 36 and 48

\subsection{Relation between the components}


\section{Management structure, milestones and procedures}

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
  * Describe the organisational structure and the decision-making ( including a list of milestones (table 3.2a))

  * Explain why the organisational structure and decision-making mechanisms are appropriate to the complexity and scale of the project.

  * Describe, where relevant, how effective innovation management will be addressed in the management structure and work plan.

  Innovation management is a process which requires an understanding of both market and technical problems, with a goal of successfully implementing appropriate creative ideas. A new or improved product, service or process is its typical output. It also allows a consortium to respond to an external or internal opportunity.

  * Describe any critical risks, relating to project implementation, that the stated project's objectives may not be achieved. Detail any risk mitigation measures. Please provide a table with critical risks identified and mitigating actions (table 3.2b)

  * Give a summary of the trans-national and/or virtual access to be provided (table 3.2c).


  {\color{red} A table for risks}

    Risk name / WP / Impact if occurs / Probability / LEvels / Prevetive and
    Contengency action.

  {\bf Definition:}
  
  \underline{Milestones}: means control points in the project that help to chart progress. Milestones may correspond to the completion of a key deliverable, allowing the next phase of the work to begin. They may also be needed at intermediary points so that, if problems have arisen, corrective measures can be taken. A milestone may be a critical decision point in the project where, for example, the consortium must decide which of several technologies to adopt for further development.
\end{todo}

\section{Consortium as a whole}\label{sec:consortium}


\begin{todo}{}\color{red}

  The individual members of the consortium are described in a separate
  section 4. There is no need to repeat that information here.

  Describe the consortium. How will it match the project’s objectives, and bring together the necessary expertise? How do the members complement one another (and cover the value chain, where appropriate)? 

  In what way does each of them contribute to the project? Show that each has a valid role, and adequate resources in the project to fulfil that role. 

  If applicable, describe the industrial/commercial involvement in the project to ensure exploitation of the results and explain why this is consistent with and will help to achieve the specific measures which are proposed for exploitation of the results of the project (see section 2.2). 

  Other countries and international organisations: If one or more of the participants requesting EU funding is based in a country or is an international organisation that is not automatically eligible for such funding (entities from Member States of the EU, from Associated Countries, from one of the countries in the exhaustive list included in General Annex A of the work programme, and, under specific conditions, from further countries identified in the work programme1,are automatically eligible for EU funding), explain why the participation of the entity in question is essential to carrying out the project .

\section{Resources to be Committed}\label{sec:resources}

\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
Please make sure the information in this section matches the costs as stated in the budget table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms, and the number of person months, shown in the detailed work package descriptions.

Please provide the following:

- a table showing number of person months required (table 3.4a)

- a table showing ‘other direct costs’ (table 3.4b) for participants where those  costs exceed 15\% of the personnel costs (according to the budget  table in section 3 of the administrative proposal forms) and participants providing trans-national access under this project and incurring travels and subsistence costs for supporting users' access.

Please note that the distribution of resources between access (TA/VA), JRA, and NA components must be duly justified.
\end{todo}

\subsection{Travel Costs and Consumables}\label{sec:travel-costs}

\subsection{Subcontracting Costs}\label{sec:subcontracting-costs}

As explained in Section~\ref{sec:subcontracting}, \site{Tum} asks for
EUR~50.000 and \site{Fau} for EUR~20.000 to subcontract Dr.\ M.\ Wenzel to
carry out (part of) the work in task
\taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}, \taskref{libraries}{afp} and
\taskref{structuring}{strontorepml}. Further EUR~15.000 are required
by \site{Tum} to subcontract Dr.\ D.\ Matthews to participate in
critical parts of task \taskref{instrumentation}{isabelle}.
\ednote{Rabe@Dowek: This is part
  of the WP7 budget. But it is not included in the PMs in WP7 because
  money for subcontracts must be declared in a different column in the
  official EU tables. Instead, it is listed here.}
