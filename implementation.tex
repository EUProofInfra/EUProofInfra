Note that 49\% of the budget is allocated to French partners.
This was difficult to
avoid because the coordinating site is French and two large formal proof
communities, the B community and the Coq community, are French.

Nevertheless the consortium is very international (11 countries)
and most European centers of excellence in formal proofs are represented.

\subsection*{In-kind contributions on the beneficiary’s premises}

As declared in the online proposal submission form, the section 3
``budget'', the Logipedia consortium has declared a number of in-kind
contributions. That is why the requested EU Contribution (K) of our
consortium is a smaller amount than the max EU contribution (J). The
community supporting the Logipedia project is wide but each partner
has been thoroughly selected and is necessary for the success of the
project. A budget of 5 millions euros is too limited to support all
the efforts of the community. The difference between the total
eligible costs for the project and the requested will therefore be
supported by some partners as an-kind contribution.

\subsection*{Justification for mission costs}

\paragraph*{DHBW/Stu}

DHBW applies only for compensation for necessary travel costs. It
provides its personnel as an in-kind donation to support the
project. In particular, it will support \WPref{atpetc} (instrumenting
an ATP to provide suitable proof traces) and \WPref{dissemination} (in
particular co-supervising a PhD-candidate with ULiege). Since DHBW does
not apply for any other funds, the mission budget is 100\% of the
total budget allocated to DHBW.

\paragraph*{ULiege/Lie}

Liege is leading \WPref{dissemination}, and will centralize the budget for
organizing the yearly Logipedia conference.  Furthermore the PhD student
co-supervised with DHBW will regularly visit DHBW, for periods that will span
several weeks.

  the organization of the four Logipedia conferences, at an
  approximate cost of 22k€ per conference, for 50 people attending.
  The rest is dedicated for the PhD student's visit to his co-supervisor,
  presenting results at conferences, and inviting external (non-EU) experts
  on some specialized aspects of \WPref{atpetc}. \\
