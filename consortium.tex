Building an infrastructure like Logipedia requires to have all the
major proof systems in the project. We currently have eighteen out of
the twenty four systems presented Figure 1, and fourteen out of the
sixteen European ones.  The only reason why we do not have them all is
because of budget limits.

This explains why the consortium has to be large.  We have twenty-nine
partners in the consortium which is almost all the groups working on
formal proof technology in Europe.  A smaller consortium would not
reach the universality which is a key factor of success.  Being such a
large consortium is a strategic decision.

Each partner brings a different expertise to the project.  Eighteen
partners bring their expertise on one specific system.  Eight partners
bring their expertise on different aspects of automated theorem
proving. Four bring their expertise on some specific library. Twelve
partners bring their expertise on a transverse issue: access (three
partners), proof engineering (nine partners), publishing (one partner).


Finally, among the twenty nine, eight are industrial partners.
Two of them are industrial research centers, six of them are companies.

Four are transverse formal methods partners and four of them are
focused on one industrial sector: transportation, health care, energy,
security, and education. These six companies are small and
medium-sized enterprises. In contrast the companies in the club of
industrial users are very different sizes, from small and medium-sized
enterprises to very large companies such as Alstom or Siemens.
