\subsection{List of Milestones}\label{sec:milestones}

\begin{todo}{from the proposal template}
  Milestones are control points where decisions are needed with regard to the next stage
  of the project. For example, a milestone may occur when a major result has been
  achieved, if its successful attainment is a requirement for the next phase of
  work. Another example would be a point when the consortium must decide which of several
  technologies to adopt for further development.

  Means of verification: Show how you will confirm that the milestone has been
  attained. Refer to indicators if appropriate. For examples: a laboratory prototype
  completed and running flawlessly, software released and validated by a user group, field
  survey complete and data quality validated.
\end{todo}

\ednote{maybe automate the milestones}

\ednote{Rabe: I suggest having only 3 milestones, namely at months 18, 36, and 48 (corresponding to the review schedule)}

\begin{milestones}
  \milestone[id=kickoff,verif=Inspection,month=1]
