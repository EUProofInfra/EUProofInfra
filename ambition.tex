\subsection{Progress beyond current achievements}

\subsubsection{Networking activities}

{\color{red} Read part D in the call (110 or such)}

This project will include several types of networking activities, to
foster a culture of cooperation between scientific communities, that
are today often too centered around one system and one theory.

First, the development of a common infrastructure is \emph{per se} a
networking activity, as the 30 partners of the project have to join
their forces towards a common goal (which is much more an integrating
activity than, for instance, organizing a common conference). Then as
the partners will also use this infrastructure for their own developments, 
they will have to understand what the other partners are doing, and how this 
can help in their own work. 

This effort will also help to develop the formal proof community in
countries where it is still at an early stage of development.

This will also strengthen a culture of cooperation between scientific
researchers and engineers in academia and in industry. Currently this
cooperation is too often point to point (for instance a company uses a
system $X$ develops links this the group of academic researchers
developing the system $X$). But we need to develop a more
comprehensive culture of cooperation, around common languages and a
common research infrastructure.

Our action in this direction is twofold. First, some companies that
already have a strong commitment in formal methods (Clearsy, CEA,
MED-EL, etc.) are included in the project as partners. May be, more
importantly, other companies, that could not be part of the project
because the project is too small, or that have a less developed
culture in formal methods are members of the ``club of industrial
users''. This club, among other goals, participates to develop a
culture of technology watch in formal methods in industry, which is a
stepping stone for developing a strong industrial awareness in safety
and security in European industry. This club also is currently too
small, but we are confident that organizing this club will only be a
first step, that will be followed by others.

It is important to develop a similar culture of technology watch for
researchers who are outside, or at the border of formal methods.  This
is why we have also organized a ``club of academic users'' that
gathers colleagues from our community that could not participate to
this project and colleagues outside the formal methods community, in
particular working mathematicians who are understanding the long term
impact formal proofs will have on mathematics.

It is also important to develop a similar culture of technology watch
for teachers, including high school teachers who are investigating how
a library of formal proofs can be used with younger students. Here we
do not advocate teaching formal proofs to pre-schoolers (we should not
repeat the mistakes of the past), but we claim that having rigorous
statements of theorems in high-school textbooks (including all the
corner cases that are often omitted in such books) and a clear
dependency of which theorem is used in the proof of which is a way to
foster a culture of rigor in high-school teaching with is both useful
for the students who will take science at University and to those who
will not. In particular, we want, in this way to contribute, with our
modest means, to the renewal of the culture of logical thinking, which
is of prime importance in our ``post-truth era''.

We also believe that an early exposition to formal statements and / or
formal proofs may contribute to compensate the shameful gender balance
in our research community. Here also we must remain modest, as t
achieving a decent gender-balance will require more than one single
action, but is is obviously much more effective to try to promote
scientific carriers to women at the high school level rather that at
the university level, because at the university level there are
already very few women in our auditoriums.

We also plan to develop networking activities with publishers
(Elsevier, Springer, etc. but also, ArXiv, HAL, Wikipedia, etc.)  in
such a way that formal proofs mentioned in research papers and in
other encyclopedia can be made accessible for a long period, while
currently, they are often just made accessible on the web page of the
authors. 

Finally, Logipedia also prepares another kind of networking activities
beyond the duration of the project, as this effort will eventually
lead to the discussion of standards for proof languages. 

We of course plan to organize the usual dissemination activities, such
as a yearly conferences with associated workshops on applications in
industry, research, education and publication, a general assembly
where the research directions can be discussed collectively. And
summer schools, specially at the beginning of the project in order to
train the new participants (doctoral students, post-docs, etc.) to the
technology developed in Dedukti and Logipedia.

\subsubsection{Transnational access}

Since our encyclopedia will be available online, it will of course be
accessible from every country in Europe and beyond.

The licence chosen for the proofs in {\sf Logipedia} and its interface
will allow a free access, a findable, accessible, interoperable, and
reusable data management.

Finally several interfaces must be developed for various audience: a
secondary school student looking for a theorem in geometry requiring a
different interface from a engineer looking for the correctness proof
of an algorithm.

This project will also help to abolish internal European borders as,
today, some researchers and engineers often use a system developed in
their own country, only a few major systems having an international
community of users.

\subsubsection{Joint research activities}

The project includes two types of joint research activities.  First,
as any infrastructure, it will allow joint research projects
between the users of this infrastructure that will be able to develop
new proofs together using different systems.

Second, as any infrastructure, {\sf Logipedia} raises new research
problems. Some of them have already been solved in the past and
require to be implemented jointly in a first version of the
encyclopedia. Others, such as automatic concept alignment, the
structure of the encyclopedia, or the development of interfaces are
newer and will trigger new cooperation between the teams of the
project.

\subsection{Innovation potential}

% Maybe too long

Formal methods are at a turning point. Several academic and
industrial successes have proved the readiness of the technology,
in particular in critical systems where it has helped in
dramatically improving the quality of the systems. But this
technology takes too much time to be adopted in a broader context.

Analyzing this phenomenon, it is clear that the redundancy of the
efforts to develop proof systems and the lack of common theories,
benchmarks, and standards for these systems is a limiting factor.
For industry, at least three key aspects slow down the adoption of
formal methods.

First, reusing a proof produced with a particular tool in another
can only be done at a high cost, when it is even possible.
{\sf Logipedia} will help reducing this cost by unifying tools
around a common format, enabling the possibility to share proofs
between tools. In the uncommon case where a proof relies on a theory
which is not compatible with the target tool, it will be easier to
understand why and determine whether adapting it is managable.
Furthermore, as an infrastucture, {\sf Logipedia} will help users
in finding existing proofs of properties, making their verification
process faster.

Second, checking a proof must remain possible over time. Today, it
requires either to maintain proofs along new versions of the tools,
which can represents a significant maintenance cost, or to archive
them together with a version of the tool used to produce it. In this
situation, {\sf Logipedia} will help on two aspects. First, the
common format will guarantee that proofs can be checked by any tool
implementing it, thus reducing proof maintenance cost. Second, by
providing a common proof database, general interest proofs can be
stored and maintained in the infrastructure, allowing industrial users
to focus their resources for their specific needs only.

Finally, a proof or verification tool can be mistrusted. For example,
in a certification context, the use of a particular tool for the
verification of the candidate system must be approved. If the
certification body is not familiar with the tool, producing a
justification for it can represent a significant amount of time. For
a new tool, adoption is even slower, as not only certification
bodies but also potential users could question its soundness despite
the potential advantages it could provide. The common format offered
by {\sf Logipedia} will answer to this lack of trust. It will help
the certification bodies, as they will not have to learn about a new
tool for each new certification process, as any tool implementing
the format will be suitable for them to check the proof. Thus they
only have to trust one. Consequently, it will also help industrial
users, as justifying the use of a particular tool will be easier as
long as they can provide a proof in the right format. And finally, it
will encourage the development of new tools, as potential users will
not have to trust these tools directly, but only the proofs that they
provide, which can be checked easily.

This project to integrate the scientific and technological effort
around formal proofs in Europe is thus a way to foster the
development of formal methods in industry, as the economic spinoffs
from the project will benefit the European industry, mainly reducing
the cost of this technology.

\subsection{Readiness of the project}

This idea of building such a standard for proofs has already been
investigated in the past, such as in the Qed manifesto \cite{Qed94}, but
has produced limited results.

Our thesis is that, since the
Qed project, the situation has radically changed. After
thirty years of research, we have an empirical evidence that most of
the formal proofs developed in one of these systems can also be
developed in another. We understand the relationship between the
theories implemented in these systems much better. We have developed
several logical frameworks, extending predicate logic, in which these
theories can be expressed. And we have developed reverse mathematics
algorithms to analyze which axioms and rules are used in each proofs
and algorithms, such as constructivization algorithms, to translate
proofs from one theory to another.
