\subsection{Research e-infrastructures for formal proofs}

Proof systems and automated theorem provers are research
infrastructures, as they allow engineers, computer scientists,
logicians, and mathematicians to build and study formal proofs, just
like particle accelerators allow physicists to build and study
particles. Each proof system comes with its own library, and these
libraries are also part of research infrastructure.

Currently these infrastructures are small, distributed and
disconnected.  Our project aims at building a large, worldwide
infrastructure from the small ones by integrating them in an
encyclopedia of formal proofs.

The integration effort is substantial because the proofs in the
various libraries are expressed in different theories, and because key
definitions are formalized in a different way.  But this integration
effort is doable and contributes to the challenge to bring European
researchers and engineers an effective and convenient access to the
best research infrastructures in order to conduct research for the
advancement of knowledge and technology.

\subsection{A starting community}

This project has never been supported under FP7 or Horizon 2020 calls.
It mobilizes twenty research groups in eleven European Countries, that is
almost all groups working on formal proof technology in Europe.

Some countries have a large number of participants, some others fewer,
reflecting the diversity of maturity of the research on formal methods
in Europe. This project will contribute to develop the formal proof
community in the European countries where it is still inceptive.

This community is also complemented with a club of industrial users and
a club of teachers.

\subsection{Compliance policy with EU regulations}

A data management plan will be provided according to Inriaâ€™s
compliance policy with EU regulations. We also engage ourselves to
make the evolution of the {\sc Logipedia} e-infrastructure compliant
with the European charter for access to research infrastructures.

\subsection{Networking activities, transnational access, joint
  research activities}

This project fosters networking activities and joint research
activities. First, between the members of the consortium, as
expressing in {\sc Dedukti} the theories implemented in the various
systems raises research questions, that for most of the systems have
been solved, but for some of them, still need to be addressed.  Then,
between the members of the consortium and other academic partners, in
particular those developing automated theorem proving systems as we
want to include also proofs coming from such systems (see the research
oriented work package 4). Then, between the consortium and the
industrial users of proof systems, because using such a system will
require to improve the user interface, develop a search engine,
concept alignment algorithms, etc.  Finally between the industrial
users themselves, as using proofs developed by others will foster joint
developments.

Such networking activities currently exist in Europe to some extent. {\sc
  Logipedia} is a unique opportunity to strengthen the existing ones and create new ones, through a
joint project.

The encyclopedia in the cloud that is the main goal of this project
will be publicly and freely accessible online through a web browser or some package management tool, so transnational
access is provided directly. Its administration will be decentralized
in various places in Europe.

\subsection{Towards standardization}
This project will be a stepping stone for a possible standardization
of proof languages. Instead of choosing one system as a standard {\em
de facto}, which is always partial, such a cooperative effort will
allow to eventually develop a standard in a cooperative way, bringing
a better and more accepted standard.

\subsection{Inter-disciplinarity}
This project includes mathematicians, logicians, and computer
scientists and therefore is clearly inter-disciplinary.

But the project is inter-disciplinary in a more fundamental
way. Proving properties of a piece of software driving a car or
piloting an aircraft require to formalize part of the physical world
in which this piece of software evolves. In the same way proving
properties of simulation software, requires to formalize some
properties of the simulated object. As mathematics and software are in
any part of modern science, formal proof will spread, over time, in
all areas of science, once it will be standardized and made more
accessible.
