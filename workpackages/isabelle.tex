% Moved to concept & methodology
% Isabelle as a logical framework \cite{paulson700} is an intermediate
% between Type-Theory provers (like Coq or Agda) and classic LCF-style
% systems (like HOL Light or HOL4). The inference kernel can already
% output proofs as $\lambda$-terms on request, but this has so far been
% only used for small examples \cite{Berghofer-Nipkow:2000:TPHOL}. The
% challenge is to make Isabelle proof terms work robustly for the basic
% libraries and reasonably big applications.  Preliminary work by Wenzel
% (2019) has demonstrated the feasibility for relatively small parts of
% Isabelle/HOL, but this requires scaling up.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item We will revisit important aspects of the Isabelle/HOL logic
  implementation on top of the Isabelle/Pure framework, such as
  normalization of proofs, efficient type-class reasoning, special
  representation of derived rules and definition principles
  (datatypes, recursion, induction). The volume of proof term output
  may be reduced further, by taking more structure of the target
  language (Dedukti) into account and omitting certain low-level
  reasoning of HOL (e.g.\ for inductive types).

  \item The underlying Isabelle/ML implementation platform (on top of
  Poly/ML) will be revisited as well, to improve monitoring of memory
  usage, and to double the standard heap size from 16\,GB to 32\,GB
  (without suffering from the full overhead of 64\,bit addressing).

\end{enumerate}
