\begin{wpobjectives}
We provide infrastructure for the structured ontological representation of libraries and use it to enrich the information about formal libraries in Logipedia.
This will enable the exchange and reuse the knowledge between prover systems.
\end{wpobjectives}


\begin{wpdescription}
We proceed in three steps.
Firstly, Tasks~\localtaskref{strlibstructure} and~\localtaskref{strdofimpl} extend the Dedukti language with features for high-level representations that are critical for accessing parts of and searching libraries.
This includes a framework to \emph{define} typed meta-data in form of ontologies, and to \emph{enforce} them in 
the Dedukti libraries.
Secondly, Tasks~\localtaskref{strrefonto} and \localtaskref{strdomonto} build ontologies serving as technical exchange format as well as domain-specific descriptions of libraries.
Thirdly, Tasks~\localtaskref{strontorepml} and \localtaskref{strtext} fill the ontology with data from both formal libraries and natural language articles and use the ontology to relate to each other.

This work package will be jointly coordinated by Florian Rabe at \site{Fau} and Burkhart Wolff at \site{Sac}.
Burkhart Wolff implemented a document ontology framework in Isabelle and developed several applications
in the field of formal software engineering.

\begin{tasklist}
\begin{task}[id=strlibstructure,title=Library Structure,lead=Fau,FauRM=12]
This task extends the Dedukti language with primitives for representing library, document, informal annotations, and theory structure.
This includes in particular the definition of unique identifiers for all declarations, which is critical for alignments.
%We extend the Dedukti language with features for high-level representations.
%This will include
%\begin{compactitem}
%\item theories: a general term we use to unify a variety of module system constructs such as type classes or locales,
%\item derived declarations: high-level declarations such as inductive type definitions, whose semantics is given by elaboration into more primitive constructs,
%\item metadata annotations: a general framework for attaching information about semantics, document structure, and tool interaction.
%\end{compactitem}
%
%The low- and high-level representations will be tightly integrated: any declaration or object may be given alternatively through either or both of these.
%The prover exports from instrumentation will be such that they produce both representations whenever possible.
%
%Then we leverage this design in several applications including automated prover interaction and a Logipedia-wide search service.
\end{task} 

\begin{task}[id=strdofimpl,title=Ontological Framework for Meta-Data,lead=Sac,SacRM=18]
This tasks extends the Dedukti language with a framework for metadata annotations.
This will cover all levels of the structure introduced in \localtaskref{strlibstructure} as well as the level of subexpressions of Dedukti expressions.
\end{task} 

\begin{task}[id=strdomonto,title= Domain Ontologies for Formal Methods in SE,lead=Tou,TouRM=12, SacRM=6]
Y. Aitameur at \site{Tou}
\begin{compactitem}
\item domain ontologies as descriptive models for engineering domains 
\item links/imports with/from standards and certification
\item engineering models annotations
\item strengthening engineering models by references to domain ontologies
\item Case studies could be certification, safety, security.
\end{compactitem}
\end{task} 

\begin{task}[id=strrefonto,title=Reference Ontology,lead=Fau,FauRM=6,SacRM=6]
This tasks compiles, integrates, and curates the various ontologies used for describing libraries in the project.
These come from several sources:
\begin{compactitem}
 \item The ontology induced by the structuring features built in task \localtaskref{strlibstructure}.
 \item The ontologies built by users using the ontology framework built in task \localtaskref{strrefonto}.
 \item Manually written ontologies or imports of existing ontologies for specific domains whose knowledge is formalized in prover libraries, such as the Upper Library Ontology developed in \cite{ulo} and the software engineering ontology from \localtaskref{strdomonto}.
\end{compactitem}
\end{task} 

\begin{task}[id=strontorepml,title=Ontological Representation of Formal Libraries,lead=Fau,FauRM=12,BolRM=6,SacRM=6]
This task extends the exports from Isabelle and Coq developed in \WPref{libraries} with structural and ontological data that conforms to the language features introduced in Tasks~\localtaskref{strlibstructure} and \localtaskref{strdofimpl}.
It will also build on the ontological export of ULO data developed for Isabelle and Coq in \cite{ulo}.

The task leader will collaborate with M. Wenzel as a sub-contractor of \site{Fau} for Isabelle and C. Sacerdoti Coen at \site{Bol} for Coq, with whom long-standing collaborations on these library exports exist.

\begin{task}[id=strtext,title=Ontological Representation of Natural Language Articles,lead=Inr,FauRM=6,InrRM=14]
    % task leader: Pierre Senellart, Inria
This task extracts ontological information from natural language research articles and link them with the formal representations in Isabelle and Coq.
P. Senellart at \site{Inr} and M. Kohlhase at \site{Fau} will work on the automatic extraction and annotation of natural-language theorem statements and proofs from published articles, as well as building libraries of such theorems and proofs.

%Since proof-objects for substantial theory developments tend to be
%very large (the representation of current POs for the Isabelle/AFP can
%easily reach several TB although using techniques for compression), A
%technical pre-requisite for interchangeability, connectivity and
%advanced search consists in a structured, typed format for meta-data
%together with a flexible mechanism of their validation. Technically,
%this kind of meta-data has the form of a function annoconst : arg1 ->
%... -> argn -> proof-term -> proof-term where annoconst is a constant
%symbol which represents an identity in the proof-term (so, any import
%function of a specific system can actually ignore it), and where the
%argi represent terms with meta-information such as, eg., “this
%proof-term represents a free data-type construction of the form ...”,
%or “this part of the proof is a derivation of a free data-type of the
%following form ...”, “this lifting over assumptions represents in
%Isabelle a Locale-instantiation”, “this part of a theory
%development is connected to ... ”, “this theorem belongs to the
%sub-class of XXX ... theorems”, etcpp. For arguments of annotations,
%validation-functions can be defined that may check that the argument
%terms satisfy a certain property wrt. to the proof-term and the
%current logical context. Dedukti will provide a framework that allows
%for each proof-system (Coq, HOL4, Isabelle...) to declare meta-data
%together with validations and thus communicate tool-specific knowledge
%to other systems. This framework can be seen as a particular form of
%an ontology definition language.
