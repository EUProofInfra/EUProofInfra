% Moved to concept & methodology
% Atelier B, Rodin and ProB are platforms or tools to develop models
% written in B method, Event-B or B system. The development process is
% based on formal proof: proof obligations are automatically  generated
% and must be proven by automatic or interactive provers. ProB is an
% animator and model checker, it helps users to gain confidence in their
% specifications. It is also a disprover aiming at  discovering
% counter-examples for proof obligations. Atelier B and Rodin use native
% B proof tool, they also enable the use of external provers such as SMT
% solvers. ProB calls SMT and SAT solvers, it also uses contraints
% solvers such as Sicstus Prolog. All of them relies on the B logics,
% mainly a first order language with set theory. Regarding B/Event-B/B
% system, there are some variants, mainly regarding the refinement
% process they all implement. Refinement means that models are developed
% by successive steps, from an abstract model to a more  concrete
% model. Refinement in B method mainly means deriving a program while
% EventB and B System refinement aim at defining a model of a system by
% introducing details.


% Moved to concept & methodology
% In the context of the BWare project, an encoding of the set theory of
% the B method has been provided as a theory modulo, i.e. a rewrite
% system rather than a set of axioms. This encoding is used by the
% automatic prover Zenon modulo which features a backend to
% Dedukti. Thus, as a first step through instrumentation of Atelier B
% and Rodin, proof obligations coming from Atelier B can be proved by
% Zenon modulo producing Dedukti proofs, hence providing a better
% confidence in the proofs produced by the native proof tools of Atelier
% B \cite{Bware}.

\begin{enumerate}

  \item Continue the encoding of the B set theory in Dedukti to be
  able to handle all kind of proof obligations and rules.

 %\item Instrument the native provers to produce proofs (in WP4 ?).

  \item Instrument and Exporting B models to Dedukti.

  \item Importing logipedia lemmas in B models

\end{enumerate}
