    Communicating and disseminating the activities and results
    generated in the project to target audiences and key stakeholders,
    and developing the communities
    of Logipedia users at the European scale.
    This includes:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item
      widely promoting and ensuring the visibility of the Logipedia project
      through tailored communication tools
      (web site, social media, etc.), channels and overall strategy, 
    \item ensuring awareness of the results by publishing them in
      journals and presenting them in international conferences,
    \item promoting the use of Logipedia and spreading our expertise
      through training workshops,
    \item developing and structuring the various communities of users
      of Logipedia (researchers, teachers, engineers, certifiers and
      publishers) through clubs with a general meeting once a year,
    \item discussing with publishers the integration of links to
      Logipedia on their platforms,
    \item providing a teaching interface for using Logipedia at
      schools and universities.
    \end{compactitem}

    Scientific research and education at all levels are concerned with
    the discovery, verification, communication, archival and usage of
    mathematical results. These tasks have been supported by physical
    books, conferences and other means. The availability of a formal
    online encyclopedia which offers in a single place the
    communication, archival and verification of mathematical knowledge
    will be of prime importance for researchers, industrials, teachers
    and editors.

%     The development and growth of Logipedia depends on two separate factors:
%     \begin{compactenum}
%      \item The development and maintenance of computer-checked proofs in the computer proof assistants supported by Dedukti as part of the Logipedia project.
%      \item The development and maintenance of import and export mechanisms for libraries of computer-checked proofs.
%     \end{compactenum}
%     For each of the two items,
    A suitable training for people at various stages of their career will be
    provided.
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item Master and PhD students.
      We will organise two summer schools on Logipedia
      and on the translation of proofs across systems.
%       training on formal proofs, proof
%       translation, and automated theorem proving.
      Both activities form an
      opportunity to improve the gender balance in our community by
      attracting female students.
    \item Engineers.
      We will develop training for employees.
      We will develop pedagogic innovations in the delivery of training,
      in support of companies.
    \item Teachers.
      We will set up a forum for exchange of tips and tricks for the use
      of computer proof assistants and formal proofs in teaching such classes.
      Particular emphasis will be on the sharing of teaching materials, which
      we will encourage to make available under free licenses.

     To foster interactions between developers and users of Logipedia, we plan the following activities.
    \begin{compactitem}
     \item Logipedia helpdesk:
    we will establish a ``Logipedia helpdesk'', as a unique, and easy-to-reach point of contact for any researcher seeking help on the use of Logipedia.
     The helpdesk will forward any incoming request for help to a suitable expert among the Logipedia developers.
     \item 
     We plan to have a ``user day'' attached to our yearly Logipedia meetings.
     During the user day, we plan to have both talks on uses of Logipedia, as well as a round table discussion featuring both developers and users, for discussing present problems and future challenges.
     \item Logipedia workshop affiliated to major conferences.
     We plan to have Logipedia workshops affiliated to conferences, to present the project to a wide range of researchers not yet involved in the project.
     \item Electronic seminar series.
     We will run an electronic seminar series, thus providing an ecological and economical way of presenting one's work and giving feedback.

    European certification authorities.
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item \href{https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/}{ANSSI} would be interested in having one unique language for formal
proofs, rather than several ones which potentially require as many
experts as the number of languages. The consortium will have to first
evaluate if Logipedia addresses 
this need.

(e.g., certification bodies) in order to introduce them to Logipedia,
and understand their potential use of Logipedia.

      title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in education,
      shorttitle=Educ.,
      lead=Str,StrRM=2,wphases=1-48!.05]
    The club of users in education gathers
    teachers who are already actively using formal proof for teaching
    in computer science, mathematics and logic but are not necessarily
    members of the community of researchers in formal theorem
    proving. These early adopters, will provide continuous feedback to
    the project members on the usability and accessibility of the
    system from this particular point of view.  More than 30 persons
    have already accepted to take part in this club.

%    Along the standard intuitive descriptions of theorem statements
%    and proofs, having a formal description is crucial in the
%    education. Indeed, students are often faced to the difficulty of
%    understanding mathematical concepts and proofs based on pieces of
%    informations found in heteregoneous sources (books, lecture notes,
%    \ldots) with varying definitions, notations. The informal proofs
%    are often given omitting details or relying on implicit knowledge
%    that students may not already be familiar with.

%    Moreover, devlopment of mathematics in education, is often based
%    not on the systematic development of mathematics in the style of
%    Bourbaki, but on so-called deductive islands: sets of local
%    assumptions used in a curriculum, a lecture or an exercise.  On
%    top of the coherent foundations provided by the base libraries
%    incorporated in Logipedia, we will need to build coherent
%    collection of mathematical results suitable for being used in a
%    given classroom.

    The role of the club of users in education will be to:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item express the needs of students and teachers with respect to proof
      presentations and tools,
    \item exchange their experience in teaching formal proofs or using
      theorem provers in class by participating in the ThEdu community,
    \item provide use cases,
    \item contribute to the dissemination of information about Logipedia.

    We will create and animate a club of users in publishing. We will invite
    people and organisation working in the publication of research
    works to join this club: publication archives (arXiv, CCSD-HAL,
    Lipics, ACM, zbMath, etc.), conference steering committees (CPP,
    ITP, POPL, CICM, etc.), journal editorial boards (JFR, JFM,
    etc.). It will be an opportunity to:

    We will build a service for Logipedia which provides an overview
    about the development in logic and an intuitive access to the
    following classes of objects - axioms - theories/calculi -
    software (theorem provers) - applications based on logic tools
    (e.g. the metro in Paris, other SAT problems)

    The objects and the relations between the objects will be
    realised via a graph. We will:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item define the objects of each class (we will start from the
      theorem provers, apply the publication-based approach for the
      software and search for references to axioms, theories, and
      applications),
    \item define a special ontology to describe linking and
      dependencies between the objects (metadata),
    \item add these metadata to all objects,
    \item provide a graph visualisation of the network (lattice) and development
      of a search engine.

    topic.
