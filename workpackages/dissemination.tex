Scientific research and education at all levels are concerned with the discovery, verification, communi- cation, archival and usage of mathematical results. These tasks have been supported by physical books, conferences and other means.
The avaibility of a formal online encyclopedia which propose in a single place the communication, archival and verification of mathematical knowledge will be of prime importance for researchers, industrials, teachers and editors.

\begin{tasklist}
  \begin{task}[id=com,title=Communication]
    We will setup a small group in charge of setting up communication
    tools targeting the different users of Logipedia: researchers,
    engineers, certification authorities, universities, teachers,
    publishers, etc. (web site, videos, mailing, etc.)
  \end{task}

  \begin{task}[id=schools,title=Training Logipedia users]
    We will organize schools targeted to the different Logipedia users:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Master and PhD students: training on formal proofs, proof
      translation, and automated theorem proving. This is an
      opportunity to improve the gender balance in our community by
      attracting female students.
    \item Engineers and certifiers: training on formal proofs tools.
    \item Teachers: training on the use of proof assistants and formal
      proofs in education.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{task}

  \begin{task}[id=research,title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in research]
    We will create and animate of club of researchers using Logipedia
    in their work. We will invite researchers on formal methods,
    theoretical computer science or mathematics to join this
    club. This club will be an opportunity for them to do:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Provide some feedback on the use of Logipedia in their work.
    \item Express their needs wrt Logipedia.
    \item Provide use cases.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{task}

  \begin{task}[id=industry,title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in the industry]
    We will create and animate a club of industrial users. We will
    invite companies working on or using formal methods to join this
    club. This club will be an opportunity for them to do:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Technology watch.
    \item Support the development of Logipedia.
    \item Express their needs wrt proof standards and proof tools.
    \item Provide use cases.
    \end{itemize}
    A meeting will be organized every year to present the advancement
    of Logipedia and discuss the use of Logipedia in the industry.
  \end{task}

  \begin{task}[id=certif,title=Expanding the use of Logipedia within certification authorities]
    We will propose to certification authorities to use the tools
    developed for Logipedia for checking some formal proofs submitted
    to them. Preliminary contact with ANSSI. Extension of other
    European certification authorities?
  \end{task}

  \begin{task}[id=education,title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in education]

The club of users in education gathers teachers who are
already actively using formal proof for teaching in computer science,
mathematics and logic but are not necessarily members of the cummunity
of researchers in formal theorem proving. These early adopters, will
provide continuous feedback to the project members on the usuability
and accessibility of the system from this particular point of view.
More than 15 persons have already accepted to take part in this club.

Along the standard intuitive descriptions of theorem statements and proofs, having a formal description is crucial in the education. Indeed, students are often faced to the difficulty of understanding mathematical concepts and proofs based on pieces of informations found in heteregoneous sources (books, lecture notes, \ldots) with varying definitions, notations. The informal proofs are often given omitting details or relying on implicit knowledge that students may not already be familiar with.

Moreover, devlopment of mathematics in education, is often based not on the systematic development of mathematics in the style of Bourbaki, but on so-called deductive islands: sets of local assumptions used in a curriculum, a lecture or an exercise.
On top of the coherent foundations provided by the base libraries incorporated in Logipedia, we will need to build coherent collection of mathematical results suitable for being used in a given classroom.

The role of the club of users of proof assistants in education will be to:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Express the needs of students and teachers wrt proof
      presentations and tools in Logipedia.
    \item Exchange their experience in teaching formal proofs or using
      theorem provers in class by participating in the ThEdu community.
    \item Provide use cases.
    \item Contribute to the dissemination of information about Logipedia.
    \end{itemize}

Delivrables:
\begin{enumerate}
\item At university level: Organization of a summer school for introducing teacher/researchers to interactive theorem proving.
\item For highschool teachers: Organization of seminars/continuous education sessions about the role of logic in maths teaching and the use of proof assistants in class.
\item For university teachers: creation and dissemination of teaching material for introduction to the concept of proof to fresh maths students.
\item intregation in Logipedia of the formalization of highschool curriculum for geometry.
\end{enumerate}


  \end{task}

  \begin{task}[id=publishers,title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in publishing]
    We will create and animate a club of publishers. We will invite
    people and organization working in the publication of research
    works to join this club: publication archives (arXiv, CCSD-HAL,
    Lipics, ACM, zbMath, etc.), conference steering committees (CPP,
    ITP, POPL, CICM, etc.), journal editorial boards (JFR, JFM,
    etc.). It will be an opportunity to:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Discuss with them how to use Logipedia to store and check
      proofs presented or used in scientific publications.
    \item Express their needs wrt Logipedia.
    \end{itemize}
