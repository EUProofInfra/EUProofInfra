  \begin{task}[id=training,
      title=Training Logipedia developers and users,
      lead=Inr,InrRM=2,IrtRM=2]
%     The development and growth of Logipedia depends on two separate factors:
%     \begin{compactenum}
%      \item The development and maintenance of computer-checked proofs in the computer proof assistants supported by Dedukti as part of the Logipedia project.
%      \item The development and maintenance of import and export mechanisms for libraries of computer-checked proofs.
%     \end{compactenum}
%     For each of the two items,
    We are planning to provide suitable training
    for people at various stages of their career:

%     We will organize schools targeted to the different Logipedia users:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item [\textbf{Master and PhD students}]
      We will support the planning and running of schools
      on various computer proof assistants.
      We are also planning to run a school dedicated to the topic of Logipedia, on the translation of proofs between different systems.
%       training on formal proofs, proof
%       translation, and automated theorem proving.
      Both activities form an
      opportunity to improve the gender balance in our community by
      attracting female students.
    \item [\textbf{Engineers and certifiers}] training on formal proofs tools.
    \item [\textbf{Teachers}]
       We will set up a forum for exchange of tipps and tricks for the use of computer proof assistants and formal proofs in teaching such classes.
       Particular emphasis will be on the sharing of teaching materials, which we will encourage to make available under free licenses.
    \end{itemize}

%     \textbf{Deliverables:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%      \item UniMath school 2022
%      \item Logipedia school 2023
%      \item An electronic forum for exchanging on the use of computer proof assistants in teaching and learning.

  \begin{task}[id=researchers-club,
      title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in research,
      lead=Bir,BirRM=2]
%     The purpose of this task is to ensure a tight interaction, and to establish a feedback loop, between, on the one hand, the developers and, on the other hand, the intended users of Logipedia.
%     Specifically, we aim to
%     \begin{compactenum}
%      \item Provide support to researchers who want to use Logipedia in their work.
%      \item Establish a forum for researchers to describe their needs, to give feedback on Logipedia, and to request features.
%      \item Build up a community of researchers, with regular exchange of ideas and use cases.
%     \end{compactenum}
     To foster interaction between developers and users of Logipedia, we plan the following activities:
    \begin{compactenum}
     \item [\textbf{Logipedia helpdesk}]
    we will establish a ``Logipedia helpdesk'', as a unique, and easy-to-reach point of contact for any researcher seeking help on the use of Logipedia.
     The helpdesk will forward any incoming request for help to a suitable expert among the Logipedia developers.
     \item [\textbf{User day at Logipedia meeting}]
     We plan to have a ``user day'' attached to our yearly Logipedia meetings.
     During the user day, we plan to have both talks on uses of Logipedia, as well as a round table discussion featuring both developers and users, for discussing present problems and future challenges.
     \item [\textbf{Electronic seminar series}]
     We will run an electronic seminar series, thus providing an ecological and economical way of presenting one's work and giving feedback.
    \end{compactenum}
%
%     \textbf{Deliverables:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%      \item Helpdesk
%      \item User days
%      \item Electronic seminar series
%     \end{itemize}

%     We will create and animate of club of researchers using Logipedia
%     in their work. We will invite researchers on formal methods,
%     theoretical computer science or mathematics to join this
%     club. This club will be an opportunity for them to do:
%     \begin{itemize}
%     \item Provide some feedback on the use of Logipedia in their work.

    % The use of formal proof tools by companies is still limited, in particular by SMEs/SMIs. The activities of the industrial club must allow the results of other WPs to be reused, in a form adapted to the variety of the involved industrial partners and their level of prior knowledge of formal proof tools. Logipedia deliverables must be shared with the industrial club in a form that facilitates operational deployment, drawing inspiration from practical cases. It will also be wise to deploy training engineering proposals dedicated to various industrial audiences by favoring a "learn by doing" approach.
    The use of formal proof tools by companies is still limited, in particular by SMEs/SMIs. The club will be an opportunity to:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Develop professional training and support offers for employees who respond to the evolution of the productive tool.
    \item Make significant changes to existing training offers.
    \item Propose meetings, create actions and shared services between large company(ies) and PMEs/SMIs.
    \item Develop pedagogic innovations in the delivery of training, in support of companies
    \item Share industrial experiences during dedicated meetings

  \begin{task}[id=certif-club,
      title=Expanding the use of Logipedia within certification authorities,
      lead=Imt,ImtRM=2]
    We will propose to certification authorities to use the tools

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{task}[id=teachers-club,
      title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in education,
      lead=Str,StrRM=2] The club of users in education gathers
    teachers who are already actively using formal proof for teaching
    in computer science, mathematics and logic but are not necessarily
    members of the cummunity of researchers in formal theorem
    proving. These early adopters, will provide continuous feedback to
    the project members on the usuability and accessibility of the
    system from this particular point of view.  More than 30 persons
    have already accepted to take part in this club.

%    Along the standard intuitive descriptions of theorem statements
%    and proofs, having a formal description is crucial in the
%    education. Indeed, students are often faced to the difficulty of
%    understanding mathematical concepts and proofs based on pieces of
%    informations found in heteregoneous sources (books, lecture notes,
%    \ldots) with varying definitions, notations. The informal proofs
%    are often given omitting details or relying on implicit knowledge
%    that students may not already be familiar with.

%    Moreover, devlopment of mathematics in education, is often based
%    not on the systematic development of mathematics in the style of
%    Bourbaki, but on so-called deductive islands: sets of local
%    assumptions used in a curriculum, a lecture or an exercise.  On
%    top of the coherent foundations provided by the base libraries
%    incorporated in Logipedia, we will need to build coherent
%    collection of mathematical results suitable for being used in a
%    given classroom.

    The role of the club of users of proof assistants in education will be to:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item Express the needs of students and teachers wrt proof
      presentations and tools in Logipedia.
    \item Exchange their experience in teaching formal proofs or using
      theorem provers in class by participating in the ThEdu community.
    \item Provide use cases.
    \item Contribute to the dissemination of information about Logipedia.
    \end{compactitem}

  \begin{task}[id=publishers-club,
      title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in publishing,
      lead=Zib,ZibRM=2]
    We will create and animate a club of publishers. We will invite
    people and organization working in the publication of research
    works to join this club: publication archives (arXiv, CCSD-HAL,
    Lipics, ACM, zbMath, etc.), conference steering committees (CPP,
    ITP, POPL, CICM, etc.), journal editorial boards (JFR, JFM,
    etc.). It will be an opportunity to:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item Discuss with them how to use Logipedia to store and check
      proofs presented or used in scientific publications.
    \item Express their needs wrt Logipedia.
    \end{compactitem}
  \end{task}

  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \begin{task}[id=zib,
      title=Expanding the use of Logipedia in publishing,
      lead=Zib,ZibRM=12]
    We will build a service for Logipedia which provides an overview
    about the development in logic and an intuitive access to the
    following classes of objects - axioms - theories/calculi -
    software (theorem provers) - applications based on logic tools
    (e.g. the metro in Paris, other SAT problems)

    The objects and the relations between the objects could be
    realized via a graph.  We could do this in the following way:
    \begin{compactitem}
    \item Defining the objects of each class (we could start from the
      theorem provers, apply the publication-based approach for the
      software and search for references to axioms, theories, and
      applications)
    \item Definition of a special ontology to describe linking and
      dependencies between the objects (metadata)
    \item add these metadata to all objects
    \item graph visualization of the network (lattice) and development
      of a search engine
    \end{compactitem}
    This gives the user a comprehensive entry point into an emerging
    topic.

  \begin{task}[id=edukera,
      title=Web interface for doing proofs at school,
      lead=Edu,EduRM=12]
      Current formal proof systems require to learn a specific formal
      language and a command-line interface to compile and execute the
      language.  This level of technicity is not compliant with mass
      adoption by teachers or students outside computer science. For
      educational purposes, it is therefore mandatory to develop an
      intuitive and easy-to-handle user-interface for the logipedia
      formal proof system. This interface, based on a WYSIWYG design
      (What You See Is What You Get), will provide two main features:
      \begin{compactitem}
      \item the structured display of the proof in a high (latex-like) quality
      \item the possibility to build the proof with simple
        point-and-click interactions
      \end{compactitem}

      The digital nature of the formal proof enables specific view features to
      understand its structure: eagle-eye view, folding/unfolding of scopes,
      highlighting the use of variables (on hover), showing/hiding context,
      and so on.

      Interactions are the point-and-click commands to develop the structure
      of the proof. They consist in applying theorems (or axioms or lemmas)
      to statements and rewriting rules to a selected element of a statement;
      this is done in deductive or abductive mode (resp. forward or backward).

      Theorems and rewrite rules should be presented and searched using
      technology developed in \WPref{dissemination}.

      The research of proof must be automated at some point in order to ease
      and speed up the process and to comply with the level of required detail
      in education; the output of \WPref{atpetc} will be used for this task.

      The development tasks are listed below:
      \begin{compactitem}
      \item graphical web component to display a Logipedia proof
      \item point-and-click interaction engine on top of Logipedia
      \item interactive proof interface application
      \end{compactitem}

      It will be possible to use the graphical proof component throughout
      the Logipedia website.
