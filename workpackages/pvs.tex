\begin{enumerate}
\item Extend PVS-cert for checking predicate subtypes: the existing encoding
  PVS-cert in $\lambda\Pi$-calculs modulo theory represents a fragment of PVS
  for which type checking is decidable. In this task, we will extend the logical
  system so that proofs corresponding to type checking conditions for predicate
  subtypes in PVS can be represented. A particular challenge is to consider two
  different proofs of the subtype being inhabited to be convertible.
\item Instrument PVS to export proofs from PVS to Dedukti: PVS proofs are
  expressed in terms of tactics that do not produce proof terms. In order to
  check PVS proofs in Dedukti, the tactics must be instrumented to produce
  explicit traces.
\item Design a PVS proof checker in Dedukti: based on the preceding tasks,
  realize the reconstruction of proofs of theorems exported from PVS from the
  accompanying proof traces.
\end{enumerate}
