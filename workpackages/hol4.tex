% Moved to concept & methodology
% The HOL4 proof assistant is home to a few medium to large scale
% specifications and associated proof developments that have value
% outside of HOL4. These specifications include the formal semantics of
% the CakeML language (and its verified compiler) and an extensive
% specification of the ARM instruction set architecture (ISA) as
% formalised by Anthony Fox at the University of Cambridge.

% Moved to concept & methodology
% HOL4 has support for exporting proofs to the OpenTheory proof exchange
% format, and there has been some work on importing OpenTheory proofs
% into Dedukti. However, the current state of these techniques and their
% implementations does not scale to real examples such as those
% mentioned above.

% Moved to methodology
%This part of the project will be about re-thinking and re-designing
%the tools HOL4-to-OpenTheory and OpenTheory-to-Dedukti tools such that
%they scale to the point where real examples of interest, such as those
%mentioned above, can be exported.


\begin{itemize}
  \item Improve the tools HOL4-to-OpenTheory and OpenTheory-to-Dedukti
  tools such that they scale to the point where real examples of
  interest can be exported.
\end{itemize}
