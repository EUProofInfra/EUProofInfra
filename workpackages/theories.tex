\begin{wpdescription}
  This work package addresses proof systems that are currently at LIL $0$, i.e.\
  whose logic and theories have not yet been expressed in \textsc{Dedukti}. Our
  objective is to bring them to LIL $2$ over the duration of the project so that
  at least elementary proofs can be exported and checked in \textsc{Dedukti}.
  For some of the systems, it may be possible to achieve LIL $3$.

  Achieving these goals requires (i) expressing the logics and proof systems
  that underlie these systems in the $\lambda\Pi$-calculus modulo theory and
  (ii) instrumenting the original proof systems so that they can export proofs
  that can be checked in Dedukti. Much of the work required in this work package
  is of foundational nature.

  The tasks are presented according to the individual systems. Nevertheless,
  the project will focus on cross-cutting concerns and foundational aspects such
  as set-theoretic vs.\ type-theoretic foundations, predicate and dependent
  types, (co-)recursive definitions and (co-)inductive proofs and so on. The
  network established in this project will avoid ``reinventing the wheel'', also
  taking advantage of the experiences of the systems considered in
  \WPref{instrumentation} and of the work carried out in \WPref{atpetc}.
