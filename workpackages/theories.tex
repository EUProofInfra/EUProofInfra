\begin{wpobjectives}
  The objective of this work package is to lay the groundwork for making
  available in \textsc{Logipedia} proofs carried out in systems that are
  currently at LIL $0$, i.e.\ for which we do not know today how to express
  their logic and theories in \textsc{Dedukti}. We intend to bring these systems
  to LIL $2$ over the span of the project.

This includes notably:
  \begin{compactitem}
  \item expressing the logics and foundational theories that underlie these
    systems in the lambda-Pi-calculus modulo theory and in \textsc{Dedukti};
  \item instrumenting these systems so that they can export proofs that can be
    checked in \textsc{Dedukti}.
  \end{compactitem}
  A key aspect will be to foster cooperation between the participating project
  sites by focusing on similar foundational aspects such as set theory vs.\ type
  theories, predicate subtyping, dependent types, proofs by induction and
  coinduction and so on.
\end{wpobjectives}

\begin{wpdescription}
  For the logical theories of the systems considered in this work package,
  namely Abella, HoTT, Minlog, Mizar, PVS, and \tlaplus, we have not yet
  investigated the possibility to express them in Dedukti and to instrument the
  systems so that they can export proofs that Dedukti can check. The individual
  tasks listed below address the challenges related to each system.

  It is interesting to note that similar problems occur in different systems,
  which are related to concepts such as set-theoretic or type-theoretic
  foundations of the system. Different type theories exhibit common traits such
  as the presence of predicate subtyping or dependent types. Similarly,
  inductive and coinductive definitions, and correspondingly proofs by induction
  or coinduction, are ubiquitous. Taking advantage of the network established
  within this project, we will avoid ``reinventing the wheel'' by designing
  generic mechanisms that can be instantiated for the different systems, also
  taking advantage of the lessons learnt for the systems with higher LIL
  considered in WP1. These challenges represent fundamental research problems:
  for example, Dedukti does not yet support coinductive proofs.
