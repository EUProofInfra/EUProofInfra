%\ednote{Give a one-paragraph run-down of the site and the team there. }


Baden-Wuerttemberg Cooperative State University (\emph{Duale
  Hochschule Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg/DHBW}) was founded in 2009, combining
none previously independent cooperative teaching academies. The
university's official seat is in Stuttgart. Based on the US State
University System, the organizational structure of DHBW is unique in
Germany, comprising a central (DHBW headquarters and Center for
Advaced Studies) and the local level (DHBW academies and subordinate
campuses). Throughout its nine acedemies and three campuses, the
university offers a broad range of undergraduate study programmes in
the field of business, engineering, and social work.

% DHBW is the first institution of higher education in Germany to
% combine on-the-job training and academic studies, thus achieving a
% close integration of theoretical academic work and practical work
% place experience. All degree programmes are both nationally and
% internationally accredited, count as intensive study programmes and
% are awaeded 210 ECTS credits. In addition, DHBW offers postgraduate
% degree programmes with integrated on-the-job training through its
% Center for Advanced Studies.

With around 34,000 enrolled students, over 9,000 partner companies and
more than 145,000 graduates, DHBW is one of the largest institutions
of higher education in the German Federal State of Baden-Wuerttemberg,
and by number of yearly graduates, one of the largest in Germany.
Since its 2009 integration as a \emph{Hochschule} proper, DHBW has
been building its research portfolio, in particular performing
cooperative reseach with its partner companies.

Among the research projects at DHBW Stuttgart is the development of
the equational theorem prover E, one of the leading theorem provers
for first-order logic.

\paragraph{Relevant previous experience:}

Stephan Schulz is the creator and a core developer of the theorem
prover E (\url{https://www.eprover.org}).  He has participated in a
number of research projects at TU Munich. He currently is a senior
collaborator in the project \emph{Matryoshka} (Principal investigator:
Jasmin Blanchette, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, ERC Starting Grant
2016 Grant agreement No. 713999), which is working towards reducing
the gap between efficient automated reasoning systems and more
expressive interactive proof assistants.
  
\paragraph{Specific expertise:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item High-performance first-order theorem proving
\item Low-overhead proof extraction from efficient reasoning processes
\item Design and implementation of languages for proof specification
  and proof object representation
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph{Staff members undertaking the work:}


\textbf{Stephan Schulz} is a tenured Professor at DHBW, with a focus
on foundations of computer science. He received his Ph.D. in Computer
Science from the Technical University of Munich in 2000, and has
taught at the University of Miami, the University of the West Indies,
and the University of Hildesheim. From 2005 to 2014 he worked as
technical project leader and project manager in the field of air
traffic control systems. He joined DHBW in Mai 2014. Dr.\ Schulz has
co-created the biannual \emph{Workshop on Practical Aspects of
  Automated Reasoning} in 2008 and the yearly \emph{Conference on
  Artificial Intelligence and Theorem Proving} in 2016. He has served
in a member of organisational roles, including as program chair of the
\emph{International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning} in 2018
and a trustee of CADE Inc.\ (ex-officio since 2017, elected 2018). His
research contributions include work in high-performance deduction
systems, AI-based search heuristics, and practical languages for proof
problems and proof objects.
