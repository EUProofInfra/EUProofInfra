\paragraph{Organization:}
% \ednote{Give a one-paragraph run-down of the site and the team there. }
The Logic and Types group at Gothenburg University has been a leading group
in the research on dependent type theory and interactive theorem proving
since the 1980's. Dr. Ulf Norell is the main developer and maintainer of
the Agda proof assistant. Dr. Andreas Abel is an expert on the meta theory
of dependent type theory and one of the core developers of Agda.

\paragraph{Main tasks:}

\begin{compactitem}
% \item\ednote{specify the main tasks and reference the respective work packages}
\item Instrument the Agda system to produce Dedukti proofs
  (\WPtref{instrumentation}).
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph{Relevant previous experience:}
% \ednote{give an overview over previous work and projects that add to the \pn project}

The group has been developing proof assistants, specifically the Agda
family of proof assistants since the early 1990's. The current version of
the system was designed and implemented by Dr. Ulf Norell as part of his
PhD thesis~\cite{norell:2007} and has been actively developed by the group
since then. Agda is widely used in both research and teaching.

\paragraph{Specific expertise:}
% \item \ednote{give three to five specific areas of expertise that pertain to the \pn project}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Implementation of proof systems.
\item Meta theory of dependent type theory.
\item Elaboration of high-level languages.
\end{compactitem}
