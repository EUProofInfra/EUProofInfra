The Logic and Types group at Gothenburg University has been a leading group
in the research on dependent type theory and interactive theorem proving
since the 1980's. The current version of the system was designed and
implemented by Dr. Ulf Norell as part of his PhD thesis and has been
actively developed by the group since then. Agda is widely used in both
research and teaching.

\paragraph*{Main tasks:}

\begin{compactitem}
% \item\ednote{specify the main tasks and reference the respective work packages}
\item Instrumenting the Agda system to produce Dedukti proofs
  (\WPtref{instrumentation}).
\item Investigating possible designs for a core language for Agda, in
  order to facilitate the exporting of Agda developments to Logipedia.
