The Logic and Types group at Gothenburg University has been a leading group
in the research on dependent type theory and interactive theorem proving
since the 1980's. The current version of the system was designed and
implemented by Dr. Ulf Norell as part of his PhD thesis and has been
actively developed by the group since then.

\paragraph*{Main tasks:}

\begin{compactitem}
% \item\ednote{specify the main tasks and reference the respective work packages}
\item Instrumenting the Agda system to produce Dedukti proofs
  (\WPtref{instrumentation}).
\item Investigating possible designs for a core language for Agda, in
  order to facilitate the exporting of Agda developments to Logipedia.
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph*{Publications, products or services:}

  \item Ulf Norell. ``Towards a practical programming language based on
  depedent types.'' PhD thesis, Chalmers University of Technology, 2007.

\paragraph*{Persons primarily responsible for carrying out the proposed activities:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item{\bf Ulf Norell} got his PhD from Chalmers University of Technology in
2007 on the design and implementation of dependently typed programming
languages. After his PhD he continued as a PostDoc at Chalmers, and since
2011 he has been working as a research engineer at Gothenburg University.
He is the main developer and maintainer of the Agda proof assistant, which
is widely used in both research and teaching. He gave the keynote at ICFP
2013, and is a member of IFIP Working Group 2.8 on functional programming.
