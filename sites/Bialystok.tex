%\paragraph*{Organization:}

The University of Bialystok (UwB) was established in 1997 from a~branch of Warsaw University after 29 years of its existence.
Today UwB is one of the largest and strongest academic centres in North-Eastern Poland.
It consists of nine faculties (including one located in Vilnius, Lithuania) and five institutes.
Classes and lectures are delivered by approx. 850 academic teachers (nearly 200 are independent research scholars).
At present UwB educates over 8000 students in almost 30 fields of study.

The Mizar research group at UwB has several decades of experience in designing formal languages 
for efficient encoding of mathematical data and implementing formal proof-checking software.
The group coordinates the development of the Mizar Mathematical Library (MML) -- 
a~large centralised collection of formalised mathematical definitions, theorems and their proofs 
authored by over 260 contributors from 20 countries.
The library is maintained and distributed in a~variety of data formats, 
including interactive web-based documents and automatically generated natural language journal articles. 
The members of the group have participated in a~number of EU funded research
and collaboration projects,
as well as the EUTYPES Cost Action.
The Mizar group has also organised the MKM 2004 and CICM 2016 conferences.

of Conference on Intelligent Computer Mathematics (CICM).
He was also the main organiser of CICM 2016 held at the University of Bialystok. 
He acts as Poland's representative in the Management Committee of the European research network on types
 for programming and verification (Cost Action EUTypes).

\item\textbf{Karol Pąk} has developed the Isabelle/Mizar system where
he specified Mizar in the Isabelle logical framework
giving the complete semantics of the system, including
the underlying first-order logic variant, soft type system, and definitional mechanisms.
