\paragraph{Organization:}

The Technical University of Munich (TUM) is characterized by a unique profile with its core domains natural sciences, engineering, life sciences and medicine. The institutional strategy is focused on strengthening the excellence of disciplinary core competences in research, teaching and learning, but is also targeted towards the promotion of ground-breaking, interdisciplinary research. TUM is committed toward the major challenges facing society in the 21st century in areas such as energy, climate, and environment, natural resources, health and nutrition, communication and information, mobility and infrastructure.
The student body of TUM is currently more than 41 000 students and is constantly rising. TUM is regularly among the best national performers in international rankings. For the fifth time in a row, TUM took the first place among the German universities in the renowned QS World University Ranking (rank 55 worldwide). Looking at the contributions published in the particularly renowned academic journals of the "Nature" Group and the "Science" Group, TUM is positioning itself as number 42 and 1st in Germany. TUM was ranked 6th in the Global University Employability Ranking in which companies worldwide evaluate the quality of university graduates. THE World University Ranking has rated the Technical University of Munich (TUM) as one of the four best technical universities in Europe. TUM placed second in comparison to all other universities in Germany and was ranked number 43 worldwide. 
TUM has been successful in all three funding lines of the German Excellence Initiative. In 2012 and 2019, TUM has again secured the title ``University of Excellence''.

\paragraph{Persons primarily responsible for carrying out the proposed activities:}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Tobias Nipkow} (co-leader of work package
  \WPref{libraries}) is a full professor for Logic and
  Verificatiuon at TUM. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science
  from the University of Manchester in 1987.  He has been a
  lecturer at the University of Manchester (1984--1987),
  post-doctoral associate at MIT (1988--1989) and at Cambridge
  University (1989-1992). He was appointed associate professor for Theory of Programming at
  TUM in 1992 and promoted to his current position in 2011. Since 2008
  he has been Editor-in-Chief of the  Journal of Automated Reasoning.
 and is currently serving on the editorial board of Logical Methods in
 Computer Science. He founded the steering committee for the
 conference Interactive Theorem Proving in 2007 and served as its
 chair until 2017.
 He has served as a program committee chair
on a number of conferences in the general area of computational logic.  Nipkow's main research
interests are in computational logic, in particular, with the design of
interactive theorem provers (he is one of the designers of the
Isabelle theorem prover), the design and semantics of programming
languages and in partticular the verification of functional and
imperative programs.
