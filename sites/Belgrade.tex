\paragraph{Organization:}
Automated Reasoning Group (ARGO, \url{http://argo.matf.bg.ac.rs}) at
Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade is interested in
automated reasoning, especially in SAT and SMT (satisfiability modulo
theories), interactive theorem proving, automated theorem proving in
coherent logic, automated reasoning in geometry, software verfication
and other applications of automated and interactive theorem proving.

\paragraph{Main tasks:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item\ednote{specify the main tasks and reference the respective work packages} 
\end{compactitem}


\paragraph{Relevant previous experience:}

Members of the group have expertise in the field of automated theorem
proving (especially in coherent logic and geometry, SAT/SMT solving,
and interactive theorem proving). They have been involved in several
national, bilateral and international projects and grants in the field
of automated reasoning (a COST project, Swiss SCOPES grant,
Serbian-French Technlology Co-Operation grant, etc).

\paragraph{Specific expertise:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Coherent-logic provers and their application in automated
  theorem proving in geometry (Janičić, Stojanović-Đurđević,
  Marinković), and automated theorem proving in geometry using
  algebraic methods (Janičić, Simić, Marić);
\item Automated solving of geometric construction problems and
  verifying correctness of solutions (Marinković);
\item Isabelle/HOL verification of underlying SAT and SMT solving
 procedures (Marić, Janičić);
\item Applications of SAT and SMT solvers integrated into Isabelle/HOL
  in verifying algorithm correctness and solving combinatorial
  conjectures in a formal, mechanical verified setting (Marić,
  Janičić);
\item Interactive theorem proving in Euclidean an Hyperbolic geometry
  (Marić, Simić)
\end{compactitem}
