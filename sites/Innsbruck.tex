%\paragraph*{Organization:}
The University of Innsbruck is a global Top-200 university and the second
largest university in Austria. UIBK has been involved in a number of FWF
projects related to formal proof, and a large number of national and
international projects including dozens of projects as part of FP5,
FP6, FP7, and H2020.
%
The research of the Computational Logic group is concerned with the logical
foundations of computer science and their application to the analysis and
verification of complex systems. The group has developed the IsaFoR library,
the largest formalisation of rewriting with more than 5000 theorems. Various
hammer systems developed in the group are today strongest automation techniques
for various formalizations including the Flyspeck project.

\paragraph*{Main tasks:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Specification of the Mizar logical foundations and type system, \WPtref{theories} \taskref{theories}{mizar}.
\item Internal proof automation using direct proof term construction, % with heuristic rewriting

\item Contributions to automatic search for alignments using neural methods, \WPtref{alignment} \taskref{alignment}{aligntheories}.

\paragraph*{Persons primarily responsible for carrying out the proposed activities:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item \textbf{Cezary Kaliszyk} has been working on making proof assistants
more accessible by developing proof automation, proof advice, and other packages for formal
proofs. He has worked on the Isabelle/Mizar object logic, where features of Mizar were
expressed in a logical framework. Kaliszyk has also worked on machine learning for interactive
proofs and has co-organized the AITP conference on the topic in the last few years (AITP). He
has developed multiple hammer systems for higher-order logic and intuitionistic type theory.
Kaliszyk has also worked on alignments between formal systems and between informal and formal
mathematics.
