\paragraph*{Organization:} The University of Leeds (UNIVLEEDS) is acclaimed world-wide for the quality of its teaching and research, and is ranked 93rd in the QS World University Rankings 2019. Leeds is in the top 10 universities in the UK (Times/Sunday Times, 2018). The results of the most recent Research Excellence Framework exercise (REF) identified that 82.76\% 
of its research activity has a top quality rating of either `world leading' or `internationally excellent' which makes it a constant member of the UK's prestigious Russell Group of research intensive universities. 
In 2017/18 it had an annual income of \pounds 715m and its annual research income exceeded \pounds 175m, of which 15.2\% was derived from EU awards. The University includes the School of Mathematics,
which hosts the Logic group, one of the strongest internationally, with expertise across the whole
spectrum of logic.
