\paragraph{Organization:}
The Programming Languages Research Group at TU Delft is an
internationally leading research group in programming languages, and
active in areas such as language engineering, language design,
domain-specific languages, software verification, and program logics.
Specifically, Dr. Jesper Cockx is an expert on the Agda system.

\paragraph{Main tasks:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Encoding of features that rely on type-directed conversion --
  such as eta-equality and definitional irrelevance -- in Dedukti
  (which does not have type-directed conversion).
\item Investigating possible designs for a core language for Agda, in
  order to facilitate the exporting of Agda developments to Logipedia.
\item Improving the current state-of-the-art on dependently typed
  languages with user-defined rewrite rules on areas such as
  confluence and termination checking.
\end{compactitem}


\paragraph{Relevant previous experience:}

Dr. Jesper Cockx is an expert on the theory and implementation of
Agda, a dependently typed programming language and proof assistant
that is widely used within the programming languages community and
beyond. He has worked on both foundational parts of Agda such as
elaboration of dependent (co)pattern matching and new extensions such
as rewrite rules and definitional proof irrelevance. He is also one of
the main contributors to the implementation of Agda.
  
\paragraph{Specific expertise:}

\begin{compactitem}
\item Elaboration of high-level programming techniques such as
  dependent pattern matching to a low-level representation that can be
  more easily transferred to other languages.
\item Extending dependently typed languages with user-defined rewrite
  rules that can be used to encode the theories of other languages.
\item Automatic translation of Agda developments to Dedukti
  (collaboration with Guillaume Genestier from Paris-Saclay).
\end{compactitem}
