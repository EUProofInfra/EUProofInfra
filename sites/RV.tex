\begin{itemize} % in alphabetical order

\item{\bf Andrei Burdușa} is a software engineer at RV Romania, involved with the
research and development of the symbolic execution and program verification
backend of the K framework.
His research interests lay in functional programming, type theory and logic.
His Bachelor's degree project at the University of Bucharest was focused on Haskell.
He is currently pursuing two Master’s degrees: one in Security and Applied Logic,
and another one in Analytic Philosophy, both from the University of Bucharest.

\item{\bf Ana Pantilie} is a software engineer at RV Romania, involved with the
research and development of the symbolic execution and program verification
backend of the K framework.
She enjoys learning about functional programming languages and formal methods.
In addition to her duties at RV, Ana is pursuing a Master's degree in Software
Engineering at the University of Bucharest.
She completed her Bachelor's degree project in Clojure, developing a music
composition application.

\item{\bf Grigore Roșu} is a full professor of computer science at the
University of Illinois and the founder of Runtime Verification, Inc., and of 
Runtime Verification Romania. He is interested in programming languages,
formal methods and software engineering, and especially in how to combine
these to increase the safety, security and dependability of computing systems.
He was offered the NSF CAREER award, the UIUC outstanding junior award,
the Dean's award for excellence in research, and several best paper awards.
Grigore got his Ph.D. from the University of California at San Diego.

\item{\bf Traian Florin Șerbănuță} is an associate professor of computer science
at the University of Bucharest and a research consultant for RV, where he serves
as the K Technical Lead.
Traian completed his Ph.D. at UIUC, working with Grigore Rosu
on the first prototype of K, which serves as a basis for the semantics-based execution
and semantics-based program verification tools developed by RV.
Additionally, Traian designed a maximal causal model for sequential consistency
which serves as a basis for runtime verification of concurrent programs in tools
such as RV-Predict.
