\ednote{a description of the legal entity}

Established in 1967, Inria is the only French public research body fully dedicated to computational sciences. It is a national operator in research in digital sciences and is a primary contact point for the French Government on digital matters. Under its founding decree as a public science and technology institution, jointly supervised by the French ministries for research and industry, Inria's missions are to produce outstanding research in the computing and mathematical fields of digital sciences and to ensure the impact of this research on the economy and society in particular. Inria covers the entire spectrum of research at the heart of these activity fields and works on digitally-related issues raised by other sciences and by actors in the economy and society at large. Beyond its structures, Inria's identity and strength are forged by its ability to develop a culture of scientific innovation, to stimulate creativity in digital research. 
Throughout its 8 research centres and its 220 project teams, Inria has a workforce of 2 400 employees (including 1600 researchers) with an annual budget of 231 million euros, 25\% of which coming from its own resources.
Inria’s mission is to pursue excellent research in computer science and applied mathematics in order to play a major role in resolving scientific, societal and industrial challenges. Therefore, Inria actively collaborates with public and private bodies including strategic partnerships with large firms, SME’s technology platforms and industrial clusters. Technology transfer is further enhanced by helping to launch new companies (since 1984, about 160 companies have stemmed from Inria) and by forming partnerships with innovative SMEs.

The institute is strongly involved in European programmes aimed at fostering scientific excellence, such as the European Research Council (58 Grants) or the Marie S. Curie Actions (24 projects in Horizon 2020).

Inria makes a firm commitment to Horizon 2020, with which the institute’s strategic plan is aligned. The objective is to combine scientific excellence with a more focused consideration of major European and global societal challenges to which Inria can bring a key contribution. Inria is currently involved in more than 140 H2020 funded projects.

Inria is also playing a lead role in the development of the Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC) EIT Digital as host of the French node. EIT Digital’s ambition is to create for Europe a structure dedicated to technology transfer and innovation in the digital field. Besides EIT Digital, Inria is also a core partner of the KIC EIT Health.

\begin{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item{\bf Stephan Merz} (co-leader of work package \WPref{theories}) is a senior research
scientist and head of the \href{https://team.inria.fr/veridis/}{VeriDis}
research group, as well as the deputy for science, at Inria Nancy\,--\,Grand Est.
His research interests are centered on the formal specification and verification
of distributed algorithms, in particular proofs of safety and liveness
properties, as well as refinement relations between specifications expressed at
different levels of abstraction. He is a main contributor to TLAPS, the \tlaplus
Proof System. He obtained his PhD (1992) and habilitation (2002) degrees at the
University of Munich and joined Inria in 2002. He published more than 100 papers
in peer-reviewed international conferences and journals and has been a PC chair
of conferences such as IFM, ICFEM, and ITP. He co-founded the FRiDA (Formal
Reasoning in Distributed Algorithms) series of workshops as well as the VTSA
(Verification Technology, Systems, and Applications) summer school. He has been
a member of the scientific directorate of Schloss Dagstuhl, as well as a member
of the Inria Evaluation Committee and of the National Committee of Scientific
Research in France.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\item {\bf Dale Miller} (co-leader of work package \WPref{reversemath}) is a senior research scientist
and former head of the Parsifal at Inria Saclay\,--\,\^Ile-de-France.  Miller
received his Ph.D. in Mathematics from Carnegie Mellon University in 1983.  He
has been on the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania (1983-1997), Penn
State University (1997-2002), and the Ecole Polytechnique (2002-2006). Miller
has been a two-term Editor-in-Chief of the ACM Transactions on Computational
Logic (ToCL) and is currently serving on the editorial board of the Journal of
Automated Reasoning. He is presently the General Chair of the ACM/IEEE Symposium
on Logic in Computer Science (LICS) and has served as a program committee chair
on a number of conferences in the general area of computational logic.  Miller
has twice received the LICS Test-of-Time Award for papers published in 1991 and
in 1994.  Miller received an ERC Advanced Grant titled “ProofCert: Broad
Spectrum Proof Certificates” for the years 2012-2016.  Miller's main research
interests are in computational logic, in particular, with the design of
automated and interactive theorem provers, the design and semantics of logic
programming and functional programming languages, and the design and
applications of proof certificates.
