The Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB) is an interdisciplinary research institute for 
applied mathematics and data-intensive high-performance computing. 
Its research focuses on modeling, simulation and optimization with scientific 
cooperation partners from academia and industry.

\paragraph*{Main tasks:}

%\ednote{its main tasks, with an explanation of how its profile matches the tasks in the proposal}

	We will initiate a group of publishers. We will invite
	people and organization working in the publication of research
	works to join this initiative: publication archives (arXiv, CCSD-HAL,
	Lipics, ACM, zbMath, etc.), conference steering committees (CPP,
	ITP, POPL, CICM, etc.), journal editorial boards (JFR, JFM,
	etc.). It will be an opportunity to:
	
	\begin{compactitem}
		\item Discuss with them how to use Logipedia to store and check proofs presented or used in scientific publications.
		\item Express their needs wrt Logipedia.
	\end{compactitem}
