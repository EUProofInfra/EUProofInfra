Université Paris-Saclay is a public research university located south of
Paris. With 275 laboratories shared with the mainstream French research
institutes, Université Paris-Saclay represents 13\% of the French
research potential.

The Laboratory for Computer Science (LRI) covers a wide spectrum of
computer science. Its VALS team works in the Area of Verification and
Validation of Algorithms, Languages and Systems, right in the heart of
the scientific field of Formal Methods. Its group working on \pn will
include Chantal Keller and Burkhart Wolff.

      partners INRIA Roquencourt, INRIA Saclay (Bruno Barras) 
      and U-PSud/LRI (B.Wolff, Project Leader) was targeting 
      of advanced parallelisation techniques for Coq and Isabelle.
\item The EU-Project EUROMILS (Oct. 2012 - Sept. 2015 ) and 
      ANR Project PST (\url{http://www.irt-systemx.fr/en/project/pst/})
      were both targeting at applying Formal Methods in an industrial
      effort aiming at a high-level certification (Common Criteria EAL6, 
      CENELEC SIL4). The latter project incited the development of 
      Isabelle/DOF\cite{brucker_achim_d_2019_3370483}.

\paragraph{Infrastructures or technical equipments:}

\ednote{a description of any significant infrastructure and/or any major

The group has a mainstream experience in interoperability between proof
systems. It is in particular the leader of the SMTCoq project, a tool to
benefit from both worlds of interactive and automatic theorem provers.
This tool allows one to check automatic theorem provers with great
confidence, as well as to enjoin proof automation in the Coq proof
assistant.

Concept alignment is fundamental in this project, to relate Coq
mathematical objects with the built-in theories of automatic provers,
and thus benefit from the best possible automation. The necessity to
align concepts for proof interoperability was pioneered by one member of
the group, in a project to import proofs between the two interactive
theorem provers HOL Light and Coq.

The group also has experience in the representation of proofs as
high-level documents. \dots

\paragraph{Persons primarily responsible for carrying out the proposed
  activities:}

\begin{itemize} % in alphabetical order

\item {\bf Dr.\ Chantal Keller} is Associate Professor at Université
  Paris-Saclay since 2015. She obtained her PhD (2013) at École
  polytechnique. She is a pioneer of interoperability between proof
  systems as the developer of one of the first tools to import proofs
  between two interactive theorem provers with very different underlying
  logics: HOL Light and Coq. In this work, the alignment of mathematical
  concepts was the key to re-usability of proofs. She is the leader of
  the SMTCoq project that links the Coq proof assistant with external
  automatic theorem provers. She has strong expertise in interactive
  (conception and use) and automatic (mainly use) theorem provers, and
  interoperability between them. She is one of the two coordinators of
  WP4.

\item {\bf Pr.\ Dr.\ Burkhart Wolff} is one of the two coordinators
  of WP7. He is full professor at Université Paris-Saclay since 2008.
  He has a strong background in interactive theorem proving for the modeling of 
  languages semantics as well as applications to model-based testing.
  He pioneered an Ontological Framework, which is currently mostly used for document
  ontologies and ontologies imposing a particular theory structure
  and typed meta-data. He implemented this framework in Isabelle/HOL, together
  with Prof. A.D. Brucker. In this EU project, his role is to supervise 
  the conception and implementation of an Dedukti-oriented ontological framework.
  He will contribute to the conception of ontologies used for prover interoperability
  as well as domain-specific ontologies supporting advanced search and access
  mechanisms. As such, he has the role of a mediator between the technical needs
  for (efficient) alignments on the one hand and end-users of the Logipedia
  libraries needing advanced search mechanisms in order to access its mathematical
  knowledge.
