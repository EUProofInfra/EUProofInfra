A detailed {\em Dissemination and communication plan} will be
delivered at month 4 (to be updated in the course of the project as
necessary). That plan will outline all of the activities to be
undertaken, including the identification of partners' participation in
international, European and national conferences and events, relevant
publication channels and opportunities for collaboration and
cooperation with other projects and initiatives. Special attention
will be given to the exploitation strategy to align the dissemination
objectives with the exploitation goals. The Plan will also:
\begin{compactitem}
\item increase the awareness of Logipedia in academia, 
\item use Logipedia as a way to increase the cooperation between academia and
industry,
\item prepare the sustainability and exploitation of Logipedia before the
  end of the project, illustrating the philosophy of 
the 
\href{http://roadmap2018.esfri.eu/media/1048/rm2018-part1-20.pdf}{2018
  roadmap} of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures
(ESFRI): 
``A robust long-term vision is essential to successfully and
sustainably develop, construct and operate Research Infrastructures.''
even if Logipedia is still in its ``incubation phase''.
\end{compactitem}

\subsection*{(a) Plan for dissemination and exploitation of results}
\label{sec:dissemination}


\subsubsection*{Dissemination}

Logipedia will strictly follow the open access policy of Horizon 2020
by providing online access to scientific information that is free of
charge to the end-user and that is reusable. In the context of this
project, scientific information refers to peer-reviewed scientific
research articles (published in scholarly journals), articles,
conference paper, etc. As such, the project will combine different
measures to foster open access to knowledge. With
reference to Open Data, Logipedia will comply with the requirements of
the Open Research Data Pilot fully.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hline
{\bf 1. Participation to conferences.}
In computer science, publishing in conference
proceedings are often favoured over journal publication. We have targeted
more than ten conferences (see below).
&
Researchers.
&
10 papers per year.
\\
\hline
{\bf 2. Organisation of conferences.}
We shall organise our own yearly event, with a conference, parallel
specialised workshops, and the general assembly, and a final
conference to draw the conclusions of the past four years and discuss the
road map for the exploitation of the infrastructure after the end of the
project.

{\bf 3. Organising summer schools}
open to anyone and not only the partners.
We shall organise several training sessions targeting the
different communities of users: master and PhD students to teach them
the foundations of Logipedia, teachers to help them use interactive
theorem provers at school and university, and to engineers to help
them use formal methods tools in their work. Such training sessions
are key dissemination events that will accompany the growing of the
Logipedia community and contribute to educate a new generation of researchers,
teachers and engineers.
&
Master and PhD students, researchers, engineers.

\subsection*{(b) Communication activities}

Communication activities aim at raising the awareness about Logipedia
to potential stakeholders that would not be concerned by our
dissemination actions. It will ensure the growth of the Logipedia
ecosystem and be a way to advertise the work achieved by the partners
and the clubs of users. It also serves the purpose of informing the
European citizen of the research findings she has been financially
contributing to.

Communication activities will be closely linked to dissemination
objectives.  Six person-months of an experienced communication
officer, from the Inria Saclay communication team, are dedicate to the
sole task of communication.  She will work in close cooperation with
the dissemination, communication, and exploitation work package
leader and the project management team.

The preparation of a Dissemination and communication plan in line with
the project dissemination and communication strategy will be one of
the first tasks to be addressed in work package 8. The Plan will identify
fundamental elements of the dissemination and communication strategy,
including:
\begin{compactitem}
\item key messages to be conveyed (what),
\item tools and channels used (how),
\item timing of the planned activities (when),
\item geographical level (local, national, European) (where) providing
  a guide for the project's and partners' dissemination activities to
  maximise the impact of Logipedia.
\end{compactitem}

In this project, we also have the ambition to communicate to the
general public, even if, in the past, these communication activities
have been considered as less important than the dissemination towards
the research, industry, and education communities.

presenting in
French the example given at the beginning of this document.}, and live
events such that the European Researchers Night or {\em La Fête de la
  Science}, focusing, as it is our habit.  & General public.  & At
least five partners organise an outreach activity in their country.
