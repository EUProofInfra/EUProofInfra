The measures to maximize impact are at the heart of the organization
of the work package dissemination and communication.
A first draft of the {\em Plan for dissemination and exploitation of
  results} will be delivered at month 4 of the project and will
be updated during the course of the project.
Here are the first elements to build this plan.
Its objectives are:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Increase the awareness and use of Logipedia in academia.
\item Use Logipedia as a way to increase the cooperation between academia and
industry. 
\item Prepare the sustainability and exploitation of Logipedia before the
  end of the project, illustrating the philosophy of 
the 
\href{http://roadmap2018.esfri.eu/media/1048/rm2018-part1-20.pdf}{2018
  roadmap} of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures
(ESFRI): 
``A robust long-term vision is essential to successfully and
sustainably develop, construct and operate Research Infrastructures.''
even if Logipedia is still in its ``incubation phase''.

{\bf 1. Participation to conferences.}
In computer science, publishing in conference
proceedings are often favored over journal publication. We have targeted
more than ten conferences:
% in alphabetical order
CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction),
CICM (Intelligent Computer Mathematics),
CPP (Certified Programs and Proofs),
CSL (Computer Science Logic),
FSCD (Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction),
FROCOS (Frontiers of Combining Systems),
ICALP (International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming),
%ICFP (Functional Programming),
IJCAR (International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning),
ITP (Interactive Theorem Proving),
LFMTP (Logical Frameworks and Meta-pLanguages: Theory
and Practice), 
LICS (Logic in Computer Science),
LPAR (Logic Programming and Automated Reasoning),
PxTP (Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving).
&
Researchers.
&
10 papers per year.
\\
\hline
{\bf 2. Organisation of conferences.}
We shall organize our own event, with a conference,
specialized workshops, and the general assembly.
&
Researchers, industrials.
&
100 participants each year.
\\
\hline
{\bf 3. Organizing summer schools}
open to anyone and not only the partners.
We shall organize several training sessions targeting the
different communities of users: master and PhD students to teach them
the foundations of Logipedia, teachers to help them use interactive
theorem provers at school and university, and to engineers to help
them use formal methods tools in their work. Such training sessions
are key dissemination events that will accompany the growing of the
Logipedia community and contribute to educate a new generation of researchers,
teachers and engineers.

{\bf 6. Disseminate Logipedia in relevant communities.}
The fours clubs contribute to the dissemination of
Logipedia in their own ecosystem, by organising talks,
courses, meetings.
&
Research, industry,
education, publishing.
&
At least one event organised by each club.
\\
\hline
{\bf 7. Delivering teaching material}
co-produced by 
the partners of the project and the members of
the club of users in education. 
&
Students
&
At least one textbook during the project.
\\
\hline
{\bf 8. Using Logipedia to increase reproducibility in science}
by referencing formal proofs in a single place. 
&
Publishers and researchers.
&
Researchers outside the consortium use Logipedia as a reference.
\\
\hline
{\bf 9. Initiate a discussion with certification authorities}
about the use of a common language across the European Union.
&
Certification agencies and the industry. 
&
Meetings are organised with several European certification agencies.
\\
\hline
{\bf 10. Use a free licence for data and software} to make 
the data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable
and develop Open data / Open science / Open innovation.
&
Scientists and innovators.
&
Delivery of Logipedia at month 14.
\\
\hline
{\bf 11. Publish in Open access venues.}
&
Scientists and students.
&
All the publications of the partners are open.

\\
\hline
\end{longtable}


Two key factors determine the sustainability of the infrastructure,
that in turn determines the sustainability of the proofs it contains.

If we succeed in making Logipedia big enough, useful, and easy to
maintain, we are confident that Inria and TUM will continue to
maintain it even after the end of this project and that we will find
other sources of finance for maintaining Logipedia, in the end of the
project.

This roadmap will be made more precise in an update of 
the {\em Plan for dissemination and exploitation of results} 
we shall write in the third year of the project.

\subsection*{(b) Communication activities}

Communication activities address several groups: the general public, through
institutional communication and outreach, and the consortium itself through
internal communication.

\paragraph*{Institutional communication}

Logipedia will have a visual identity, a logo, flyers presenting the
project, and a web site to be identified, and defined, by all partners,
stakeholders, and institutions we work with.

These communication activities are included in the budget under the
work package ``Dissemination and communication''.

\paragraph*{Outreach}

As the European citizen must be informed of the progress of science
she funds, we will, as it is our habit, publish popular science
articles in magazines, online videos, and live events such that the
European Researchers Night or {\em La FÃªte de la Science}, focusing
both on the scientific results and on the values, such a project
carries.


\paragraph*{Internal communication}

The goal of the internal communication is to allow each partner to
know what the others are doing. Actions exist at different levels.

\begin{compactitem}
\item The yearly event is a way to communicate the main scientific and
  technological progress of each partner.
\item The steering committee meets on a regular basis, through a
  teleconference, and exchanges about managerial, scientific, and
  technological issues.
\item Within each work package, the task leaders meet, through a
  teleconference, on a regular basis to coordinate the action of the
  work package.
\item Within each task, the partners communicate on teleconference, to
  coordinate the action of the work package. Some tasks have a budget
  to organize meetings, depending on their needs.
\end{compactitem}

\paragraph*{Monitoring communication activities}

Different types of communication activities are monitored in
different ways.  The institutional communication activities are
monitored by the leader of the work package ``Dissemination and
communication''. The internal communication activities are monitored
by the project coordinator and each work package leader. The communication
in conferences and workshops is monitored by the
the leader of the work package ``Dissemination and
communication''. And the outreach activities are monitored by the
project coordinator.
