The measures to maximize impact are at the heart of the organization
of the work package dissemination and communication.
A first draft of the {\em Plan for dissemination and exploitation of
  results} will be delivered at month 4 of the project and will
be updated during the course of the project.
Here are the first elements to build this plan.
Its objectives are:
\begin{compactitem}
\item Increase the awareness and use of Logipedia in academia.
\item Use Logipedia as a way to increase the cooperation between academia and
industry. 
\item Prepare the sustainability and exploitation of Logipedia before the
  end of the project, illustrating the philosophy of 
the 
\href{http://roadmap2018.esfri.eu/media/1048/rm2018-part1-20.pdf}{2018
  roadmap} of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures
(ESFRI): 
``A robust long-term vision is essential to successfully and
sustainably develop, construct and operate Research Infrastructures.''
even if Logipedia is still in its ``incubation phase''.
\end{compactitem}

{\bf 1. Participation to conferences.}
In computer science, publishing in conference
proceedings are often favored over journal publication. We have targeted
more than ten conferences:
% in alphabetical order
CADE (Conference on Automated Deduction),
CICM (Intelligent Computer Mathematics),
CPP (Certified Programs and Proofs),
CSL (Computer Science Logic),
FSCD (Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction),
FROCOS (Frontiers of Combining Systems),
ICALP (International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and Programming),
%ICFP (Functional Programming),
IJCAR (International Joint Conference on Automated Reasoning),
ITP (Interactive Theorem Proving),
LFMTP (Logical Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory
and Practice), 
LICS (Logic in Computer Science),
LPAR (Logic Programming and Automated Reasoning),
PxTP (Proof eXchange for Theorem Proving).
&
Researchers.
&
10 papers per year.
\\
\hline
{\bf 2. Organisation of conferences.}
We shall organize our own event, with a conference,
specialized workshops, and the general assembly.
&
Researchers, industrials.
&
100 participants each year.
\\
\hline
{\bf 3. Organizing summer schools}
open to anyone and not only the partners.
We shall organize several training sessions targeting the
different communities of users: master and PhD students to teach them
the foundations of Logipedia, teachers to help them use interactive
theorem provers at school and university, and to engineers to help
them use formal methods tools in their work. Such training sessions
are key dissemination events that will accompany the growing of the
Logipedia community and contribute to educate a new generation of researchers,
teachers and engineers.

to educate a new generation of researchers and engineers, 
Some will have academic and industrial co-advisors.

{\bf 6. Disseminate Logipedia in relevant communities.}
The fours clubs contribute to the dissemination of
Logipedia in their own ecosystem, by organising talks,
courses, meetings.
&
Research, industry,
education, publishing.
&
At least one event organised by each club.
\\
\hline
{\bf 7. Delivering teaching material}
co-produced by 
the partners of the project and the members of
the club of users in education. 
&
Students
&
At least one textbook during the project.
\\

{\bf 8. Using Logipedia to increase reproducibility in science}
by referencing formal proofs in a single place. 
&
Publishers and researchers.
&
Researchers outside the consortium use Logipedia as a reference.
\\
\hline
{\bf 9. Initiate a discussion with certification authorities}
about the use of a common language across the European Union.
&
Certification agencies and the industry. 
&
Meetings are organised with several European certification agencies.
\\
\hline
{\bf 10. Use a free licence for data and software} to make 
the data is findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable
and develop Open data / Open science / Open innovation.
&
Scientists and innovators.
&
Delivery of Logipedia at month 14.
\\
\hline
{\bf 11. Publish in Open access venues.}
&

\subsection*{(b) Communication activities}

Communication activities aim at raising the awareness about Logipedia
to potential stakeholders that would not be concerned by our
dissemination actions. It will ensure the growth of the Logipedia
ecosystem and be a way to advertise the work achieved by the partners
and the clubs of users. It also serves the purpose of informing the
European citizen of the research findings she has been financially
contributing to.

Six person-months of an experienced communication officer, from the
Inria Saclay communication team, are dedicate to the sole task of
external communication.  She will work in close cooperation with the
all dissemination, communication, and exploitation work package leader
and the project management team.

In this project, we have the ambition to communicate to the general
public, even if, in the past, these communication activities have been
considered as less important than the dissemination towards the
research, industry, and education communities.
