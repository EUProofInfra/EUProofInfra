{\color{red} Speak about TRL}

The measures to maximize impact are at the heart of the organization
of the work package dissemination and communication. They will be made
more precise in the {\em Dissemnination and communication} that will
be delivered at month 3 of the project. Their overall objective is to
prepare the sustainability of Logipedia after the end of this
integrating phase of our starting community.

\subsection*{(a) Dissemination and exploitation of results}
\label{sec:dissemination}

\subsubsection*{Publications, conferences, etc.}

The first dissemination activity is, of course, the publication of
scientific papers. In computer science publication in conference
proceedings are often favored over journal publication. The
conferences relevant to our area of research are FSCD, (Formal
Structures for Computation and Deduction), LICS (Logic in Computer
Science), ICALP (International Colloquium on Automata, Languages, and
Programming), CSL (Computer Science Logic), CADE (Conference on
Automted Deduction) / IJCAR (International Joint Conference on
Automated Reasonning). Note that the first paper on the $\lambda
\Pi$-calculus implemented in Dedukti was published in TLCA (now FSCD)
and the first invited lecture was delivered at ICALP. We should also
mention two smaller, but more specific venues, LFMTP (Logical
Frameworks and Meta-Languages: Theory and Practice) and PxTP (Proof
eXchange for Theorem Proving), that the development of Logipedia
should promote.

We shall also organize our own yearly event, with a conference,
specialized workshops, and the general assembly.

A second classical type of dissemination event is the organization of
summer schools. We shall organize two. A first one during the first
year of the project and a second one durin the third year. Such summer
schools, specially the first one is a key dissemination event, that
will accompany the growing of the Logipedia community in the first
year of the project.

The project will also increase the cooperation between academia and
industry, both with the participation to the same events, such as the
Logipedia conference, workshops, but also by co-advising PhD students
and participating in joint meetings, such as those of the advisory
board.

\subsubsection*{Clubs of users}

The second, less classical, type of dissemination activity, is the
organization of four clubs of users that is a first step towards
extending the community to all stakeholders, beyond the partners of
the project.

Each club will organize a yearly workshop at the annual Logipedia
event. More dissemination activities will take place in these clubs,
for instance the redaction of teaching material in club of users in
education, new reproducible reference practices in the club of users
in publishing, new use cases and new certification processes in the
club of industrial users.

\subsubsection*{Open access and intellectual property}

The dissemination and exploitation of our data is different from many
other projects, as the key to the success of such an infrastructure is
to make the data as open and as free as possible so that the data is
findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable. Such data cannot be
subject to a patent. They should not be subject of intellectual
property and thet should not distributed under a too restrictive
licence.  The only limitation to this is that we may need to include,
in Logipedia, libraries that already have a licence, that must be
preserved.  For the formal proofs that come to Logipedia without a
pre-existing licence, we suggest to use a cc-by licence or a similar
one.

Moreover the data we shall collect contains no personal data, so this
simplifies the ethical issues and the compliance to the GDPR.

We will comply to the Open research data pilot, as will be formalized
in the data managdement plan we shall release at month 3 and in the
consortium agreement that will be signed before the project starts

\subsubsection*{Exploitation}

An encyclopedia, by essence, must remain accessible for a very long
period of time. So out goal is that Logipedia, that will be hosted by
Inria Saclay and by die Technische Universität München, remains
accessible long after the project is finished. 

Two key factors determine the sustainability of the infrastructure,
that itself determine the sustainability of the proofs it contains.
\begin{itemize}
\item First, its architecture must be simple enough so that it requires
  little maintenance to preserve the proofs it contains, and even to
  allow more theories and more proofs to be integrated.
\item Second, it must contain enough proofs so that its usefulness has been
demonstrated, and it becomes ``too big to fail''.
\end{itemize} 

If we succeed in making Logipedia, big enough, useful, and easy to
maintain, we are confident Inria and TUM will maintain it.

Of course, we do not want the encyclopedia just to be maintained, but
there still will be more to be done after the end of the project. The
roadmap to continue to develop Logipedia after the end of the project
is twofold. First, there will be some work similar to that conducted
during the project such as integrating more libraries (for instance,
the ACL2, or the Nuprl libraries that are not addressed in the
project), developing better search engines for formulas, etc. 

Then, some theme emerged during the preparation of this proposal such
as ``Logipedia, security, and certification'', ``Logipedia and
automated theorem proving'', ``Logipedia and the B method''... that
could be projects on their once this project is over.

This road map will be made more precise in the exploitation plan 
we shall write in the third year of the project. 

\subsection*{(b) Communication activities}

Communication activities address several needs. 

\subsubsection*{Institutional communication}

As any project Logipedia will need to have a visual identity, a logo,
flyers presenting the project, and a web site. 
This way, the project can be identified, and defined, by all partners, 
stake holders, and institutions we work with. 

This communication activities are in the budget of the work package
``Dissemination and communication''

\subsubsection*{Internal communication}

The goal of the internal communication is to allow each partner to
know what the others are doing. Actions exist at different levels.

\begin{itemize}
\item The yearly event is a way to communicate the main scientific and
  technological progress of each partner.

\item The steering committee meets on a regular basis, through a
  teleconference, and exchanges about managerial, scientific, and
  technological issues.

\item Within each work package, the task leaders meet, through a
  teleconference, on a regular basis to coordinate the action of the
  work package.

\item Within each task, the partners communicate on teleconference, to
  coordinate the action of the work package. Some tasks have a budget
  to organize meetings, depending on their needs.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Open conference and workshops}

To permit the growth of the community beyond the partners and the
members of the clubs, the yearly conference and workshop will be
advertised and open for communications to academic and industrial
researchers who are not members of the project.

\subsubsection*{Outreach} 

Finally, as the European citizen must be informed of the progress of
science she funds, we shall use our habit to publish popular science
articles in magazines and online videos, focusing both on the
scientific results and on the values, such a project carries.

\subsubsection*{Monitoring communication activities}

Different types of communication activities are monitored in a
different way.  The institutional communication activities are
monitored by the leader of the work package ``Dissemination and
communication'' . The internal communication activities are monitored
by the project coordinator and each work package leader. The communication 
in conferences and workshops is monitored by the 
the leader of the work package ``Dissemination and
communication''. And the outreach activities are monitored by the 
project coordinator.
