- Exploitation: how will the results be exploited, how will the project
continue (road map), what will remain to be done

Here we can speak about after 2024 (only place in the document)

Inria and TUM are going to make sure the infrastructure remains active

We shall write a consortium agreement, that will be signed before the
project starts [[[demander à Inria quel modèle utiliser (DESCA ?)]]]
Talk about IP here. No IP : open source, no patents on algorithms.
The consortim sill follow the EU guidelines for IP rights.
Everything will be published. IP will be mentioned in the General assembly.



No backgroud IP, except on some libraries
we shall preserve.

The details about all these will be given in the consortium agreement.

\subsection{Communication activities}


\begin{todo}{}\color{red}
  Describe the proposed communication measures for promoting the project and its findings during the period of the grant. Measures should be proportionate to the scale of the project, with clear objectives.  They should be tailored to the needs of different target audiences, including groups beyond the project's own community.

  See participant portal FAQ on how to address communication activities in Horizon 2020.

  For further guidance on communicating EU research and innovation for project participants, please refer to the H2020 Online Manual on the Participant Portal.
