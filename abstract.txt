Digital infrastructures are the backbone of our societies, whose solidity therefore depends on the reliability of these infrastructures. Because a single bug can cause people to die and enterprises to go bankrupt, formal methods, and in particular formal proofs, are crucial for the European economy and for the development of a safe, secure, and ethical European information society. They are also crucial to strengthen the citizens' confidence in science and technology. Mastering this technology of formal proofs and its evolution is vital for Europe to remain competitive.

Formal proofs are developed using research infrastructures called "proof systems", that permit to build and study formal proofs, just like particle accelerators permit to build and study particles. But the development of formal methods, in research, industry, and education, is slowed down by the lack of integration of these infrastructures, that hinders interoperability, sustainability, and cross-verification of formal proofs. After three decades dedicated to the development of these systems, the natural next step is their integration. To achieve this goal, we aim at building a new research infrastructure, called Logipedia, that is an open, on line encyclopedia of formal proofs.

The time is indeed ripe to enhance the European strategy and build such a research infrastructure across Europe: after three decades of research, we now have empirical evidence that most of the formal proofs developed in one of these systems can also be developed in another. We understand the relationship between the theories implemented in these systems much better. We also have logical frameworks to express the theories implemented in these systems and algorithms to translate proofs from one theory to another.

Such a project requires to federate a large community, hence our consortium of twenty-eight partners, from eleven European countries, comprising most European centers of excellence in formal proofs.
